People supervising these systems often rely on information relayed by the system to make any decisions, which places a burden on the system to self-assess its proficiency and communicate the relevant information. Proficiency self-assessment benefits from an understanding of how well the models and decision mechanisms used by robot align with the world and a problem holder’s goals. This paper makes three contributions: (1) Identifying the importance of goal, system, and environment for proficiency assessment; (2) Completing the phrase “proficient ‹preposition›” using an understanding of proficiency span; and (3) Proposing the proficiency dependency graph to represent causal relationships that contribute to failures, which highlights how one can reason about their own proficiency given alterations in goal, system, and environment. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference Paper,"['Environment', ' Goal(s)', ' Intelligent agents', ' Proficiency', ' Self-assessment', ' SystemDrones', ' Human engineering', ' Intelligent systems', ' Real time systems', ' Security of data', ' Autonomous systems', ' Causal relationships', ' Decision mechanism', ' Dependency graphs', ' Real-time application', ' Self assessment', ' Social robots']"

A relevant question in control engineering education is: How to close the gap between theory and practice? Once subjects are introduced in theoretical classes, students want to know about its practical use. Thus, it is important to introduce theoretical control concepts with practical experiments, enabling students to easily test and validate the theory. An Arduino based temperature control laboratory (TCLab) is deployed in this study as a portable kit providing students with a simple and effective means to test some feedback control techniques.

Structural DSE of turbomachinery compressor blades is often challenging because the large number of design variables make it difficult to learn the effect that each variable has upon the stress contours. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the stress contours is used as a way to understand how the stress contours change over the design space. Two methods are introduced to address the challenge of understanding how the stress changes over a large number of variables. First, a two-point correlation is applied to relate the design variables to the scores of each principal component. Second, a coupling of the stress and coordinate location of each node in PCA is developed which also indicates how the stress variations relate to geometric variations. These provide insight to how design variables influence the stress. It is shown how these methods use PCA as DSE tools to better explore the structural design space of compressor blades. Better DSE can improve compressor blades and the computational cost needed for their design.

This, in turn, is making feasible new tools such as immersive, collaborative, design environments that reflect the collaborative environment of drafting tables while still providing all the power of modern, computer-based, design tools. However, before such an environment can be fully realized, basic issues surrounding collaboration in VR such as cybersickness and disorientation must be more fully addressed. This work presents the results of an experimental study conducted to characterize the trade-offs between different styles of transitioning collaborators to a shared view in an immersive virtual environment. The experimental task consisted of asking participants to identify in which quadrant of the car specific components were located. Quadrant identification was performed after a participant's virtual location was transitioned to a shared view location focused on the component to identify. The study was conducted with 45 participants who provided 1890 transition response datapoints. Analysis of these results suggests that, in many cases, collaborators are willing to experience some mild cybersickness in order to reduce their disorientation and improve both confidence and accuracy of component location identification. The results also support the recommendation that the best practice is to provide support for multiple transition styles and allow collaborators to select their preference. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"['Collaboration', ' Cybersickness', ' Immersive', ' Spatial awareness', ' Viewpoint', ' Viewpoint sharing', ' Virtual RealityEconomic and social effects', ' Location', ' Collaborative environments', ' Design environment', ' Immersive virtual environments', ' Immersive virtual reality', ' Location identification', ' Multiple transitions', ' Specific component', ' View locations', ' Virtual reality']"

Additionally, information about CPSs is gathered from both the phasor measurement units (PMU) and SCADA-based measurements. This measurement transfer introduces two network observability types, which split the system into observable (White) and unobservable (Grey) areas, based on 1) deployed measuring instruments (MIs) and 2) received measurements.

Current industrial methods generally utilize monoethanolamine for CO2 capture; however, the CO2 regeneration requires a high temperature and energy demand during every adsorption/desorption process, along with material losses. Many solid amines with high capture capacity and stability are developed as adsorbents to overcome the limitations. However, the environmental impacts caused by adsorbents themselves are not holistically considered and discussed; meanwhile, material syntheses and consumptions are also associated with CO2 emission. To determine the environmental impacts and identify hotspots of novel CO2 capture adsorbents, two carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine, physically adsorbed and covalently bonded, were compared with traditional monoethanolamine method using life cycle assessment. The carbon payback periods were also analyzed to gain understanding on whether the currently evaluated novel materials are suitable for industrial application. Results suggest that, material usage, especially carbon nanotubes, contributes the majority of the overall environmental impacts for both types of carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine. Meanwhile, their carbon payback periods are over 40 times longer than monoethanolamine during the synthesis phase. However, the energy consumption of physically adsorbed polyethyleneimine saves up to 60% compared to monoethanolamine in every adsorption/desorption cycle due to its lower heat capacity. In addition, the rate of cumulative CO2 remission for carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine is twice higher than monoethanolamine, indicating the potential application for industrial CO2 capture. Overall, our study indicates that current status of solid amine has a potential in CO2 capture, but requires much improvements. Future research should pay attention on decreasing the initial material synthesis and increasing the product life time due to their high environmental tradeoffs. Meanwhile, our study highlights that unilateral emphasis of the CO2 capture efficiency by novel materials may not be adequate, comprehensive considerations should be focused on the comparison throughout material life cycles including use and preparation phases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"['Carbon nanotube', ' CO2 capture', ' Life cycle assessment', ' Payback period', ' Solid amineAmines', ' Carbon dioxide', ' Carbon nanotubes', ' Climate change', ' Energy utilization', ' Environmental technology', ' Ethanolamines', ' Investments', ' Life cycle', ' Specific heat', ' Adsorption/desorption', ' Covalently bonded', ' High temperature', ' Industrial methods', ' Material synthesis', ' Monoethanolamine', ' Polyethyleneimine', ' Preparation phasis', ' Environmental impact']"

The process remains to be implemented on a wide scale in the automotive and aerospace industries, partially due to the relatively short number of welds producible by a toolset, prior to needing cleaning. In the following work, an investigation was conducted to better understand this limitation. First, the effective tool life of a steel toolset was quantified. Experiments showed that less than 60 consecutive welds could be made before the toolset seized and required cleaning. To better understand the conditions contributing so such a short tool life, thermocouples were used in subsequent experiments, to measure the temperatures achieved at various locations in the weld. Peak weld temperature increased with longer cycle times and decreased with shorter cycle times. During the experiments, it was noted that weld temperatures in excess of 500 °C were observed at weld center. At these high temperatures, the authors anticipate that intermetallic compounds (IMCs) are able to grow on tool surfaces. A rough, existing model of IMC growth in an Fe-Al system predicted IMC growth on the same order of magnitude of the tool clearances, supporting the anticipation that IMC growth is a factor in the observed, short tool life between cleanings.

To overcome locking, the strain variables are interpolated with lower-order spline bases while the variations of the strain variables are interpolated with the corresponding Bézier dual bases.

Organizations may emphasize these priorities through various forms of performance feedback. However, the impacts of using feedback to emphasize speed, quality, and quantity remain unclear in production settings. This study employs controlled laboratory experiments to examine the impact of real-time feedback on production quantities, first time yield percentages, and rework percentages. Drawing on concepts from speed-accuracy tradeoffs, we study four types of feedback: speed, accuracy, joint speed and accuracy, and yields. Laboratory activities focus on the repetitive task of converting paper-based medical records to electronic data formats. These tasks are critical inputs to data analytics and are similar in nature to simple independent manufacturing and service tasks. We study feedback effects in a setting critical to practice but rarely studied in research, where workers are incentivized for both speed and quality as they perform production tasks that explicitly allow rework. The results show that production yields worsen under speed feedback but improve under each form of quality-containing feedback.

In this work, an experimental prototype of this concept is realized and its performance is analyzed. In particular, we demonstrate the capability of maintaining a spacecraft component at a desired operating temperature through the expansion and contraction of a collapsible radiator to control radiative heat loss. Four aluminum panels are connected via a flexible hinge constructed from interwoven copper wires and suspended from an actuating framework. The radiator panels are connected to a heated aluminum block. The radiator is placed in a vacuum environment with cooled surroundings (173 K) and the total radiative cooling power is determined as a function of radiator actuation position for a constant aluminum block temperature. As the radiator actuates from extended to collapsed, the heat transfer decreases and the fin efficiency increases. For a limited actuation range, the four-panel radiator exhibits a turn-down ratio (largest cooling power / smallest cooling power) of 1.31. A numerical model validated in this work predicts a turn-down ratio of 2.27 for actuation over the full range of radiator positions in surroundings at 4 K.

Specifically, a two-stage process was used to maximize the use of the carbon in coal or increase the carbon monoxide yield or lower carbon dioxide and methane yields. Carbon dioxide-char gasification in the absence of water can generate carbon monoxide with near-zero methane, which is desired to produce high-carbon and low-hydrogen chemicals such as oxalic acid through catalytic carbon monoxide coupling and hydrolysis. The technology is applicable to any coal, although Power River Basin (PRB) coal is used as an example feedstock in this research Also, the sodium-iron catalyst can accelerate not only the reaction kinetics in both stages but also increase the hydrogen/carbon monoxide ratio in the syngas produced in the second stage. In other words, the catalyst is a multifunctional agent, which can not only intensify the overall coal process efficiency but also improve the qualities of the desired syngas products and reduce carbon dioxide emission. Thus, In the 1st stage, the catalysts can significantly reduce the CO2-char gasification by as high as 75.00%. In the 2nd stage, the H2/CO ratio of ideal syngas is ∼2:1 with near-0 CH4 generation and the CH4 production can be reduced as high as 61.29% for the CO2–H2O-Char coal gasification. The activation energy for the 2nd stage is reduced by as high as 35.43% than that of raw coal without use Na–Fe catalyst. The overall carbon footprint reduction for the study is reduced by 87.33% in the 1st stage and 96.77% compared to the direct coal combustion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"['Catalysis', ' CO2 reduction', ' Coal', ' Gasification', ' Ideal syngas', ' PyrolysisActivation energy', ' Carbon dioxide', ' Carbon dioxide process', ' Carbon footprint', ' Carbon monoxide', ' Catalysts', ' Coal', ' Global warming', ' Iron research', ' Methane', ' Oxalic acid', ' Reaction kinetics', ' Synthesis gas', ' Synthesis gas manufacture', ' Carbon and hydrogens', ' Carbon dioxide emissions', ' Carbon footprint reductions', ' Char gasification', ' Multifunctional agents', ' Process efficiency', ' Syngas production', ' Two-stage process', ' Coal combustion']"

The filter fuses data from an inertial measurement unit and altimeter with relative-pose updates from a keyframe-based visual odometry or laser scan-matching algorithm. Because the global position and heading states of the vehicle are unobservable in the absence of global measurements such as GPS, the filter in this article estimates the state with respect to a local frame that is colocated with the odometry keyframe. As a result, the odometry update provides nearly direct measurements of the relative vehicle pose, making those states observable. Recent publications have rigorously documented the theoretical advantages of such an observable parameterization, including improved consistency, accuracy, and system robustness, and have demonstrated the effectiveness of such an approach during prolonged multirotor flight tests. This article complements this prior work by providing a complete, self-contained, tutorial derivation of the relative MEKF, which has been thoroughly motivated but only briefly described to date.

The effect of different algae and AS ratios on the chemical oxygen demand (COD), N-NH4 + and P-PO4 3− removal was studied. The removal efficiency of COD was above 93 % for the three tested algae and AS inoculum ratios (5:1, 1:1, and 1:5). The reactor with algae: AS inoculum ratio of 5:1 achieved the highest final N-NH4 + and P-PO4 3− removal efficiencies (88.0 ± 1.0 % and 84.0 ± 1.0 %, respectively). Furthermore, the highest biomass concentration (1.96 g L-1 from initial amount of 0.3 g L-1) was observed in the reactor with algae: AS ratio of 5:1.

These interviews were also used to discover how social impact might be considered in a design setting moving forward. This is not a study to find “the state of the art,” but considers the average engineering professional's work to design products in various industries. Social impact assessments (SIA) and social life cycle assessments (SLCA) are two of the most common processes discussed in the literature to evaluate social impact, both generally and in products. Interestingly, these processes did not arise in any discussion in interviews, despite respondents affirming that they do consider social impact in the product design. Processes used to predict social impact, rather than simply evaluate, were discussed by the respondents. These tended to be developed within the company and often related to industry imposed government regulations. To build on this study, the findings herein should be further validated for executives, managers, and engineers. A study specific to these roles should be designed to understand the disconnect better. Additionally, processes should be developed to assist engineers in considering the social impact of their products. Work should also be done to help educate engineers and their leaders on the value of considering the social impact in product design.

State-of-the-art algorithms for calculating the relative pose between two images use matching features to estimate the essential matrix. The essential matrix is then decomposed into the relative rotation and normalized translation between frames. To be robust to noise and feature match outliers, these methods generate a large number of essential matrix hypotheses from randomly selected minimal subsets of feature pairs, and then score these hypotheses on all feature pairs. Alternatively, the algorithm introduced in this paper calculates relative pose hypotheses by directly optimizing the rotation and normalized translation between frames, rather than calculating the essential matrix and then performing the decomposition. The resulting algorithm improves computation time by an order of magnitude. If an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is available, it is used to seed the optimizer, and in addition, we reuse the best hypothesis at each iteration to seed the optimizer thereby reducing the number of relative pose hypotheses that must be generated and scored. These advantages greatly speed up performance and enable the algorithm to run in real-time on low cost embedded hardware.

Follow-up experiments have been recommended in the literature to separate the effects of significant but confounded strings of two-factor interactions in resolution IV designs. Recently, an analysis based on conditional main effects (or CMEs) has been shown to be useful in determining which interaction in a confounded string of two-factor interactions is actually causing the significance without the need for follow-up experiments.

Because the MMSE equalizer filter coefficients are a function of the carrier frequency offset (CFO), the equivalent discrete-time channel, and the noise variance, reliable estimates of those parameters are required. The CFO is due primarily to the high velocity of the airborne transmitter. Because the equivalent discrete-time channel in aeronautical telemetry is sparse, the performance of the joint estimator based on a sparse channel estimator is superior to the performance of a traditional nonsparse maximum-likelihood-inspired joint estimator. The improvement is seen in lower estimator error variances for the parameters, particularly for the CFO and channel estimate, and in the postequalizer bit-error rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the postequalizer bit-error rate using the sparse estimator is almost as good as that using ideal estimators. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",Article,"['Aeronautical telemetry', ' continuous phase modulation (CPM)', ' frequency-selective multipath', ' shaped offset QPSK (SOQPSK)', ' sparse channel estimationBit error rate', ' Equalizers', ' Errors', ' Frequency allocation', ' Maximum likelihood', ' Mean square error', ' Telemetering equipment', ' Aeronautical telemetry', ' Carrier frequency offsets', ' Discrete-time channels', ' Filter coefficients', ' Frequency selectivity', ' Minimum mean squared error equalizers', ' Reliable estimates', ' Viable solutions', ' Parameter estimation']"

The development of an odometry-like, front-end, EKF-based estimator that utilizes only a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is presented. The filter uses the measurement model of the multi-state-constraint Kalman filter. The filter also regularly resets its origin in coordination with the declaration of keyframe images. The keyframe-to-keyframe odometry estimates and their covariances are sent to a global back end that represents the global state as a pose graph. The back end is better suited to represent nonlinear uncertainties and incorporate opportunistic global constraints. We also introduce a method to account for front-end velocity bias in the back-end optimization.

Growth in BJ applications is driven by the use of finer powders and improved post-processing methods that can produce dense, homogenous final parts. However, understanding of the basic droplet/powder interaction is relatively limited. This paper considers the impact of in-process drying, part geometry, and droplet size on a key printing parameter: binder saturation. Parts of varying thicknesses are printed with a range of saturation levels under various heating conditions. The ratio of the printed part mass to the theoretical part mass is used to detect bleeding. In unheated powder beds, part mass increases linearly with printing saturation levels across the range tested (30 %–130 %). However, when the powder is heated between layers, there is a wide range of print saturation levels (30–80 %) over which increasing binder saturation or droplet volume does not increase the part mass. This stable part mass corresponds to accurate part geometries without bleeding and is likely due to enhanced evaporation of the binder solvent between layers. Smaller droplet volume (42 pl) was also shown to decrease saturation levels in unheated powder bed and in single layer parts. The differences in part mass with print saturation and droplet volume are most pronounced in thin parts. These observations lead to a simple method for determining an appropriate print saturation parameter for a powder/binder combination in thick parts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"['Binder Jetting', ' Inkjet printing', ' Saturation', ' Stainless Steel3D printers', ' Additives', ' Drying', ' Ink jet printing', ' Saturation (materials composition)', ' Stainless steel', ' Additive manufacturing process', ' Droplet volume', ' Drying condition', ' Heating conditions', ' Postprocessing methods', ' Saturation levels', ' Saturation limits', ' Saturation parameters', ' Drops']"

To explain this, it has been observed that as a network grows certain subsets of the network begin to specialize the function(s) they perform. A recent model of network growth based on this notion of specialization has been able to reproduce some of the most well-known topological features found in real-world networks including right-skewed degree distributions, the small world property, modular as well as hierarchical topology, etc. Here we describe how specialization under this model also effects the spectral properties of a network. This allows us to give the conditions under which a network is able to maintain its dynamics as its topology evolves. Specifically, we show that if a network is intrinsically stable, which is a stronger version of the standard notion of global stability, then the network maintains this type of dynamics as the network evolves. This is one of the first steps toward unifying the rigorous study of the two types of dynamics exhibited by networks. These are the dynamics of a network, which is the topological evolution of the network's structure, modeled here by the process of network specialization, and the dynamics on a network, which is the changing state of the network elements, where the type of dynamics we consider is global stability.

As an efficient synthetic basis feature descriptor, SYnthetic BAsis (SYBA) requires low computational complexity and provides accurate matching results. However, the number of matched feature points generated by SYBA suffers from large image scaling and rotation variations. In this paper, we improve SYBA’s scale and rotation invariance by adding an efficient pre-processing operation. The proposed algorithm, SR-SYBA, represents the scale of the feature region with the location of maximum gradient response along the radial direction in Log-polar coordinate system. Based on this scale representation, it normalizes all feature regions to the same reference scale to provide scale invariance. The orientation of the feature region is represented as the orientation of the vector from the center of the feature region to its intensity centroid. Based on this orientation representation, all feature regions are rotated to the same reference orientation to provide rotation invariance. The original SYBA descriptor is then applied to the scale and orientation normalized feature regions for description and matching. Experiment results show that SR-SYBA greatly improves SYBA for image matching applications with scaling and rotation variations. SR-SYBA obtains comparable or better performance in terms of matching rate compared to the mainstream algorithms while still maintains its advantages of using much less storage and simpler computations.

In order for RFSSW to become a readily implementable welding solution, cycle times must be reduced to an acceptable level, similar to that of well developed, competing spot joining processes. In the present work, an investigation of the RFSSW process is conducted to evaluate factors that have traditionally prevented the process from achieving fast cycle times. Within this investigation, the relationship between cycle time and joint quality is explored, as is the meaning and measurement of cycle time in the RFSSW process. Claims and general sentiment found in prior literature are challenged regarding the potential for high-speed RFSSW joints to be made. The RFSSW weld design-as described by process parameters such as tool feed rate, tool rotational velocity, and plunge depth-is shown through experimentation to affect the loads and torques placed on RFSSW tooling and machines during the welding process. As cycle time is decreased, the load and torque on the toolset are shown to increase. Similarly, as tool rotational velocity is decreased, the load and torque on the toolset is shown to increase. The relationship between machine design limitations and cycle time is also explored. It is demonstrated that welds with cycle times below one second can be produced without compromising material properties, suggesting that high speed RFSSW can be enabled through informed efforts. © 2020 SAE International.

While there are clear benefits to predicting the social impact of an engineered product, it is unclear how engineers should select indicators and build predictive social impact models that are functions of engineering parameters and decisions. This paper introduces a method for selecting social impact indicators and creating predictive social impact models that can help engineers predict and improve the social impact of their products. As a first step in the method, an engineer identifies the product's users, objectives, and requirements. Then, the social impact categories that are related to the product are determined. From each of these categories, the engineer selects several social impact indicators. Finally, models are created for each indicator to predict how a product's parameters will change these indicators. The impact categories and indicators can be translated into product requirements and performance measures that can be used in product development processes. This method is used to predict the social impact of the proposed, expanded U.S. Mexico border wall. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

In recent years however, research in optimization, optimal control, and simulation has enabled some forms of nonlinear model predictive control which find locally optimal solutions. The limiting factor for applying nonlinear MPC for robotics remains the computation necessary to solve the optimization, especially for complex systems and for long time horizons. This letter presents a new solution method which addresses computational concerns related to nonlinear MPC called nonlinear Evolutionary MPC (NEMPC), and then we compare it to several existing methods. These comparisons include simulations on torque-limited robots performing a swing-up task and demonstrate that NEMPC is able to discover complex behaviors to accomplish the task. Comparisons with state-of-the-art nonlinear MPC algorithms show that NEMPC finds high quality control solutions very quickly using a global, instead of local, optimization method.

For this purpose, ODT is extended in two ways. First, a forcing scheme that maintains statistical stationarity is introduced. Unlike direct numerical simulation (DNS) of forced turbulence, the ODT framework accommodates forcing that is not directly coupled to the momentum equation. For given forcing the ODT energy dissipation rate is therefore the same in particle-laden cases as in the corresponding single-phase reference case. Second, previously implemented one-way-coupled particle phenomenology is extended to two-way coupling using the general ODT methodology for flow modulation through interaction with any specified energy and momentum sources and sinks. As in a DNS comparison case for Reλ=70, turbulence modulation is diagnosed primarily on the basis of the fluid-phase kinetic-energy spectrum. Because ODT involves subprocesses with straightforward physical interpretations, the ODT mechanisms of particle-induced turbulence modulation are clearly identified and they are plausibly relevant to particle-laden Navier-Stokes turbulence. ODT results for the ratio of particle-phase and fluid-phase kinetic energies as a function of particle Stokes number and mass loading are reported for the purpose of testing these predictions in the future when these quantities are evaluated experimentally or using DNS. © 2020 authors.

The present study deals with the seismic responses of bridge-abutment transition backfills (BATBs), which are essential components of HSR bridges. BATBs provide a gradual variation of vertical stiffness between the bridge deck and nominal engineered backfill, enabling smooth operations for trains traveling at high speeds. All prior investigations focused on this vertical stiffness in order to better characterize the localized vertical differential movements around BATBs under periodic high axial loads from train sets. Lateral behavior of BATBs, which would be important under seismic loads, has not previously been investigated.

Currently, improvements in small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) technology can be used to quantify sagebrush morphology and community structure with high resolution imagery on western rangelands, especially in sensitive habitat of the Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). The emergence of photogrammetry algorithms to generate 3D point clouds from true color imagery can potentially increase the efficiency and accuracy of measuring shrub height in sage-grouse habitat. Our objective was to determine optimal parameters for measuring sagebrush height including flight altitude, single-vs. double-pass, and continuous vs. pause features. We acquired imagery using a DJI Mavic Pro 2 multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB camera, flown at 30.5, 45, 75, and 120 m and implementing single-pass and double-pass methods, using continuous flight and paused flight for each photo method. We generated a Digital Surface Model (DSM) from which we derived plant height, and then performed an accuracy assessment using on the ground measurements taken at the time of flight. We found high correlation between field measured heights and estimated heights, with a mean difference of approximately 10 cm (SE = 0.4 cm) and little variability in accuracy between flights with different heights and other parameters after statistical correction using linear regression. We conclude that higher altitude flights using a single-pass method are optimal to measure sagebrush height due to lower requirements in data storage and processing time. © 2020 by the authors.

However, its complete oxidation has been a challenge. Dimethyl viologen, as an electron mediator, has been shown to promote high levels of glucose oxidation under aerobic conditions. Nevertheless, the efficiency of viologen-mediated glucose oxidation has been low in electrochemical experiments. In this study, viologen-mediated oxidation of glucose was investigated under anaerobic electrochemical conditions to understand the factors that impact the oxidation efficiency. Of particular interest was the improvement of electrochemical oxidation for glucose fuel cell applications. An experimental cell was developed to electrochemically reoxidize the mediator as it was homogeneously reduced by glucose under anaerobic conditions. In contrast, the mediator was reoxidized by direct reaction with oxygen under aerobic conditions. The aerobic oxidation efficiency was 75%, three times larger than the maximum efficiency in the electrochemical cell. 13C-NMR results show that the main product formed under aerobic conditions was formic acid, whereas glycolic acid was the principal product formed in the electrochemical cell. Carbonate was only formed under aerobic conditions. Therefore, the use of oxygen to reoxidize the mediator also directly influenced the glucose oxidation pathway. In the electrochemical cell, the oxidation efficiency depended on the electrochemical reaction rate of the mediator and was higher at faster rates. The efficiency also depended on the initial molar ratio of the mediator to glucose. The maximum oxidation efficiency of glucose in the electrochemical cell was approximately 22%, which is about three times larger than the maximum efficiency for precious-metal-based anodes. © 2019",Article,"['Carbohydrate fuel cell', ' Glucose fuel cell', ' Glucose oxidation', ' Oxidation efficiency', ' Viologen mediatorAnodes', ' Electrochemical cells', ' Fuel cells', ' Glucose', ' Molar ratio', ' Oxygen', ' Reaction rates', ' Electrochemical conditions', ' Electrochemical experiments', ' Electrochemical reaction rates', ' Fuel cell application', ' Glucose fuel cells', ' Glucose oxidation', ' Oxidation efficiency', ' Viologens', ' Electrochemical oxidation', ' anoxic conditions', ' electrochemical method', ' electrode', ' experimental study', ' fuel cell', ' glucose', ' oxic conditions', ' oxidation', ' reaction rate']"

Limits of achievable FW cooling rates are primarily determined by thermal and geometric properties such as thermal diffusivity and length. A controller limits interface temperatures during a weld preheat, changing the thermal profile and slowing post-weld cooling. This method is demonstrated in 1045 steel. Cooling simulations, TTT diagrams, microhardness line scans, and scanning electron microscopy are used for analysis.

The initial and deformed distribution of orientations greatly influences the sensor behavior, since the quantum tunneling model is highly sensitive to the polymer gaps between nanoparticles; the evolution of these gaps under deformation is strongly dependent upon the relative orientation of neighboring particles, and determines electron transport properties, and overall sensor response.

This work examines laser sintering (LS) of a blend of demineralized bone matrix (DBM) and polycaprolactone (PCL) using a CO2 laser beam. A comprehensive experimental study was carried out to find the conditions that form defect-free layers while still retaining the favorable biological features of DBM. The results identify a process setting window over which LS can be utilized to constructing complex patient-specific scaffolds. With the identified setting, first, the DBM/PCL blend was fused in the LS machine. Parts were then were further strengthened through a post-processing heat treatment. The shrinkage level, skeletal density, mechanical testing, and porosimetry of the resultant samples were compared to traditional machined DBM blocks. The maximum tensile strength of the samples and post-processing shrinkage depends on heat treatment duration. The tensile strength measurements demonstrate that the post-processing conditions can be tuned to achieve the tensile strength of the demineralized bone strips. Evaluation of the dimensional change suggests that the shrinkage along the laser paths is ~0.3% while thickness shrinks the most (up to ~20%). The porosimetry and density studies showed that the final part achieved over 40% porosity with a density comparable to blocks of DBM. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In addition, the experiments explore char gasification rates under kinetically controlled conditions that should highlight the effects of ash. By contrast, diffusion controlled burning rates may mask the types of ash effects observed here. The experimental and theoretical results indicate that refractory material such as ash reduces kinetic reaction rates by rendering portions of the surface area inert as char burnout proceeds and ash content increases. Ash also affects particle size in a somewhat compensatory manner. A theoretical model has been developed to quantify the ash effect.

Although the use of bicrystal property data to construct GB structure–property models is more direct, in many experimental situations the only type of data available may be measurements of the effective properties of polycrystals. In this work, we investigate the possibility of inferring GB structure–property models from measurements of the homogenized effective properties of polycrystals when the form of the structure–property model is unknown. We present an idealized case study in which GB structure–property models for diffusivity are inferred from noisy simulation results of two-dimensional microstructures, under the assumption that the number of polycrystal measurements available is larger than the number of parameters in the inferred model.

Applying an integral analysis within the boundary layer results in a system of differential equations, which was solved numerically to obtain boundary layer thickness and local and average values of the Nusselt number. The classical smooth hydrophobic scenario with no-slip and no temperature jump showed excellent agreement with previous analyses of the same problem. Solutions were obtained for laminar Rayleigh number ranging from 104 to 109 at a Prandtl number of 7. There was a modest decrease in the boundary layer thickness due to the increased slip length and the flow velocity decreased due to the increased temperature jump length. The local Nusselt number decreased as the temperature jump length increased, with greater reduction at larger Rayleigh numbers and near the lower edge.

By modeling the aging of a cell as a Markovian process, an interacting multiple-model Kalman filter (IMM) can be utilized to determine a time-varying probability mass function that specifies the probability that each of the models under consideration is the best representation of the cell under observation. While the output of the IMM is useful by itself, its predictions can be improved by post-processing.

Four large-grained tantalum tensile specimens were strained in uniaxial tension, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data were collected, and geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) maps of the four specimens in the unloaded state were produced. EBSD-based GND maps revealed several types of features with high GND content which caused back stress in the specimens. Correlations between five geometrically-based grain boundary (GB) transmission factors and the GB GND content were evaluated, and statistically significant correlations were found for transmission factors based on Livingston and Chalmer's N factor, Werner and Prantl's slip transfer number, and GB misorientation. The sign of individual components of the Nye tensor were used to visually and quantitatively identify clustering of GNDs of the same sign, thus giving additional evidence of increasing back stress due to deformation. Deformation of one of the specimens was simulated using multiple CPFEM based modeling approaches and predicted stress-strain responses are compared. The super dislocation model (SD model) — a crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) which incorporates elastic dislocation interactions — was able to isolate impact of back stress on the overall flow stress. The SD model predicted correct stresses when compared with experimental data; however, when the elastic interactions in the SD model were turned off, stress predictions were 25% too low.

Over recent years, this has led to the implicit assumption that the quality of such embeddings is determined solely by their ability to facilitate transfer learning. In this position paper we argue that pre-trained linguistic embeddings have value above and beyond their utility as input features for downstream tasks. We adopt a paradigm in which they are instead treated as implicit knowledge repositories that can be used to solve common-sense reasoning problems via linear operations on embedded text. To validate this paradigm, we apply our methodology to tasks such as threat detection, emotional classification, and sentiment analysis, and demonstrate that linguistic embeddings show strong potential at solving such tasks directly, without the need for additional training. Motivated by these results, we advocate for empirical evaluations of language models that include vector-based reasoning tasks in addition to more traditional benchmarks, with the ultimate goal of facilitating language-based reasoning, or ‘reasoning in the linguistic domain’. We conclude by analyzing the structure of currently available embedding models and identifying several shortcomings which must be overcome in order to realize the full potential of this approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference Paper,"['Common-sense reasoning', ' Language model evaluation', ' Language models', ' Sentence embeddings', ' Word embeddingsClassification (of information)', ' Computational linguistics', ' Intelligent computing', ' Sentiment analysis', ' Transfer learning', ' Based reasonings', ' Commonsense reasoning', ' Emotional classification', ' Empirical evaluations', ' Implicit knowledge', ' Internal representation', ' Linear operations', ' Threat detection', ' Embeddings']"

This improvement can be shown by using a continuous time Markov chain. However, typical Markov chain models do not model common cause failures (CCF), which is a singular event that simultaneously causes failure in multiple redundant modules. This paper introduces a new Markov chain to model CCF in TMR with repair systems. This new model is compared to the idealized models of TMR with repair without CCF. The fundamental limitations that CCF imposes on the system are shown and discussed. In a motivating example, it is seen that CCF imposes a limitation of 51× on the reliability improvement in a system with TMR and repair compared to a simplex system, (i.e., without TMR). A case study is also presented where the likelihood of CCF is reduced by a factor of 18× using various mitigation techniques.

The inflatable joints used in this article consist of a strong fabric exterior that constrains two opposing compliant air bladders that generate torque (unlike McKibben actuators where pressure changes cause translation). This antagonistic structure allows the simultaneous control of position and stiffness. However, dynamic models of soft robots that allow variable stiffness control have not been well developed. In this work, a model that includes stiffness as a state variable is developed and validated. Using the stiffness model, a sliding mode controller and model predictive controller are developed to control stiffness and position simultaneously. For sliding mode control (SMC), the joint stiffness was controlled to within 0.07 Nm/rad of a 45 Nm/rad command. For model predictive control (MPC) the joint stiffness was controlled to within 0.045 Nm/rad of the same stiffness command. Both SMC and MPC were able to control to within 0.5° of a desired position at steady state. Stiffness control was extended to a multiple-degree-of-freedom soft robot using MPC. Controlling stiffness of a 4-DOF arm reduced the end-effector deflection by approximately 50% (from 17.9 to 12.2cm) with a 4 lb (1.8 kg) step input applied at the end effector when higher joint stiffness (40 Nm/rad) was used compared with low stiffness (30 Nm/rad).

Permitted phasing allows vehicles to turn left after yielding to opposing vehicles; protected phasing provides an exclusive phase for vehicles to turn left without opposition; and protected-permitted phasing combines these phasing alternatives, allowing both permitted and protected turning movements. Intersections with 1, 2, and 3 opposing-lane configurations with permitted and protected-permitted models (split into green times of 10, 15, and 20 s) were analyzed for a total of 12 simulation models.

Concurrent advancements in computational power, continuum theory, and experimental diagnostics are enabling unprecedented understanding of such interactions. However, we cannot develop a sufficient level of confidence in such mesoscale capability until the constitutive description of the underlying constituents is reliably representative of their actual physical behavior. Therefore, there is a strong need to combine experimental, modeling, and data-science techniques to validate models of the thermomechanical response of individual single crystals. One experimental diagnostic with high potential impact to shock physics and materials science is in-situ x-ray diffraction. This paper is primarily focused on simulation of x-ray diffraction in shock physics, but with an aim toward quantifying parametric uncertainty of simulation models. We develop and demonstrate a data-science and model-driven approach to constrain the parameterization of continuum models of crystal lattice deformation associated with the shock response of crystalline materials. The framework is built around the connection between continuum hydrodynamic simulations of lattice deformation and a new Bragg diffraction simulation code, BarberShop. The dynamic deformation of a crystal lattice is modeled using the DiscoFlux model within an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian hydrodynamic code, FLAG. These detailed continuum simulations of lattice deformation can be computationally slow, thus a statistical model is used to emulate the evolution of lattice deformation fields in time and across the considered model parameter space. Emulated lattice deformation fields can then be generated rapidly for any combination of physics model parameters. In turn, these fields can be fed into BarberShop to realize a rapid prediction of Bragg diffraction patterns associated with particular values of physics model parameters. The framework enables parameterization of the single crystal model to obtain Bragg diffraction patterns that most closely resemble a corresponding measurement. Furthermore, the framework naturally provides sensitivities of the lattice deformation to the physics parameters. We highlight the utility of this framework through the application to a synthetic closed-loop inverse problem leading to the parameterization of a single crystal material model. As a model problem, we consider the dynamic response of the energetic molecular crystal, cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (or RDX), under dynamic compression induced by simulated flyer plate impact experiments. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",Article,"['Bragg diffraction', ' Lattice deformation', ' Machine learning', ' Shock physics', ' Single crystal model', ' X-rayBragg cells', ' Codes (symbols)', ' Computation theory', ' Continuum mechanics', ' Crystal lattices', ' Crystallites', ' Data Science', ' Deformation', ' Diffraction patterns', ' Hydrodynamics', ' Interferometry', ' Molecular crystals', ' Nanocrystalline materials', ' Parameterization', ' Single crystals', ' X ray diffraction', ' Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian', ' Crystal lattice deformation', ' Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine', ' Dynamic compression experiment', ' In-situ X-ray diffraction', ' Parametric uncertainties', ' Single-crystal materials', ' Thermo-mechanical response', ' Inverse problems']"

The evaders can be UAVs, marine or ground vehicles, or human agents, but they have a lower maximum speed than the pursuer throughout the game. Simple motion is assumed for the pursuer and evaders with complete state information shared across all agents.

The value of the game is the minimum distance to the bottom border achieved by the evaders at any time before capture of both evaders.

In previous studies, low-frequency surface vibrations have been used to alter wetting states of droplets by exciting droplet volume modes. While high-frequency (>20 kHz) surface vibration can also cause droplets to wet or spread on a surface, this effect is relatively uncharacterized. In this study, droplets of various liquids with volumes ranging from 2 to 70 μL were vibrated on hydrophobic-coated (FluoroSyl) glass substrates fixed to a piezoelectric transducer at varying amplitudes and at a range of frequencies between 21 and 42 kHz. The conditions for contact line motion were evaluated, and the change in droplet diameter under vibration was measured. Droplets of all tested liquids initially begin to spread out at a similar surface acceleration level. The results show that the increase in diameter is proportional to the maximum acceleration of the surface.

However, recent modifications to large eddy-simulation (LES) methods allow for simulations of jets operating at a high-temperature ratio in a similar regime as military aircraft operating at afterburner. This work applies coherence analyses that have been previously used to study the jet noise field produced by military aircraft to the LES of a highly heated laboratory-scale jet. The coherence of the complex pressures along a near-field line approximately parallel to the shear layer as well as along the nozzle lip line shows evidence of distinct noise production mechanisms that transfer information differently from the flow to the field. A phenomenological comparison between the LES and measurements of an afterburning F-35 aircraft is then made. Although the LES is not run at the exact same conditions as the aircraft and does not reproduce all of the phenomena present in the aircraft’s jet noise field, differences between noise production mechanisms observed in the LES may describe some of the spatiospectral lobe phenomena observed in the measurements of the F-35. © 2020 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Although these enhancements appeared to be successful at improving safety, there was a need to evaluate their effectiveness. This research evaluates the safety impacts of several pedestrian crossing enhancements using Utah-specific compliance rates of drivers as a surrogate safety measure. This study analyzes enhanced pedestrian crossings to determine the factors that affect the compliance of driver yielding in Utah and provides a statistical analysis to prove the significance of each factor on compliance. The results show that the “High-intensity Activated crossWalK” (HAWK) is more effective at reducing the probability of a non-compliant event compared with an overhead flashing beacon (OFB), and that an OFB is more effective at reducing the probability of a non-compliant event compared with a rectangular rapid flashing beacon (RRFB) or an overhead rectangular rapid flashing beacon (ORRFB). The results show that adding a pedestrian enhancement to a marked crosswalk at a location with five lanes and speed limit between 35 mph and 45 mph can increase compliance rate by 97% for the HAWK, 77% for the OFB, and 57% for the RRFB and ORRFB. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",Article,

Often these analogies require approximations, but in the limit of large radii where TCF becomes rotating plane Couette flow (RPC) exact relations can be established. When the flows are restricted to two spatial independent variables, there is an exact specification that maps the three velocity components in RPC to the two velocity components and one temperature field in RBC. Using this, we deduce several relations between both flows: (i) heat and angular momentum transport differ by, explaining why angular momentum transport is not symmetric around even though the relation between, the Rayleigh number, and, a non-dimensional measure of the rotation, has this symmetry. This relationship leads to a predicted value of that maximizes the angular momentum transport that agrees remarkably well with existing numerical simulations of the full three-dimensional system. (ii) One variable in both flows satisfies a maximum principle, i.e. the fields' extrema occur at the walls. Accordingly, backflow events in shear flow cannot occur in this quasi two-dimensional setting. (iii) For free-slip boundary conditions on the axial and radial velocity components, previous rigorous analysis for RBC implies that the azimuthal momentum transport in RPC is bounded from above by, where is the shear Reynolds number, with a scaling exponent smaller than the anticipated. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

The method uses a multilevel framework called relative navigation and visual-inertial odometry: Both of which have been used for singlevehicle GPS-denied navigation. This work modifies the relative navigation architecture by adding the necessary elements to enable decentralized, cooperative operations. The proposed framework also includes the ability to incorporate intervehicle measurements and uses a new concept called the coordinated reset, which is necessary for optimizing the cooperative odometry and improving localization. A simple communication protocol is presented, as well as flight-test results that show its effectiveness. The method is first demonstrated in simulation, including Monte Carlo testing, to show the expected improvement gained from cooperation. Finally, results from hardware testing are presented that show the ability of the system to reject initialization errors, to operate with temporary communications dropouts, and to greatly reduce the total amount of shared data compared to a naive approach.

Human supervision and remote robot control are often required to operate robots in unpredictable and changing scenarios. Often, robots are controlled remotely by technicians via joystick interfaces which require training and experience to operate. To improve robot usage and practicality, we propose using augmented reality (AR) to create a more intuitive, less training-intensive means of controlling robots than traditional joystick control. AR is a creative platform for developing robot control systems, because AR combines the real world (the environment around the user, the physical robot, etc.) with the digital world (holograms, digital displays, etc.); it can even interpret physical gestures, such as pinching two fingers. In this research, a Microsoft Hololens headset is used to create an AR environment to control a Yaskawa Motoman SIA5D robot. The control process begins with the user placing an interactable holographic robot in 3D space. The user can then select between two control methods: manual control and automatic control. In manual control, the user can move the end effector of the holographic robot and the physical robot will respond immediately. In automatic control, the user can move the end effector of the holographic robot to a desired location, view a holographic preview of the motion, and select execute if the motion plan is satisfactory. In this preview mode, the user is able to preview both the motion of the robot and the torques experienced by the joints of the manipulator. This gives the user additional feedback on the planned motion. In this project we succeeded in creating an AR control system that makes controlling a robotic manipulator intuitive and effective. © 2020, Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.",Conference Paper,"['Augmented reality', ' Force feedback', ' Microsoft Hololens', ' Motion planning', ' Robotic armAugmented reality', ' Dynamics', ' End effectors', ' Feedback', ' Holograms', ' Holographic displays', ' Man machine systems', ' Manipulators', ' Manual control', ' Motion planning', ' Process control', ' Robotic arms', ' Robotics', ' Structural dynamics', ' Complex operations', ' Force feedback', ' Human supervision', ' Interactive robot', ' Joy-stick interfaces', ' MicroSoft', ' Robot control systems', ' Robotic manipulators', ' Robot programming']"

Acoustic source identification techniques’ have been used for remote structural health monitoring, but the applicability of each technique has been limited by factors ranging from achievable spatial resolution to hardware costs. This paper aims to mitigate current acoustic techniques’ limitations by exploring the possibility of fusing acoustic and video data. This paper focuses on combining microphone acoustic measurements with vibrational information recovered from video-based measurements. Among acoustic methods, acoustic arrays have been used for remotely detecting, localizing and characterizing acoustic sources. Acoustic-array based techniques are limited in their ability to discriminate multiple closely-spaced acoustic sources from far-field acoustic pressure signals. On the contrary, video-based techniques have shown the ability to recover full-field, high resolution mode shapes, and the associated frequencies and damping ratios with virtually no dependence with the distance from the target. The challenge with video methods, applied to acoustic source identification, is that acoustic sources may occur in the kilohertz range requiring a higher frame per second sampling rate than most low cost cameras. Acoustic measurements provide additional information content that is used to recover the correct frequency content of an acoustically radiating structure from temporally-aliased (sub-Nyquist) video measurements.

The moderating role of operational failures,Journal of Operations Management,,5.0,10.1002/joom.1015,"Hospital providers often use workarounds to circumvent processes so that patients can receive care. Workarounds in response to operational failures enable care to continue and therefore may be indicative of workers' commitment. On the other hand, workarounds in the absence of operational failures may signal an ineffective approach associated with lower quality of care and worse patient outcomes. Working closely with healthcare providers, we developed a survey to measure workaround behaviors and operational failures on medical/surgical units. The lead author surveyed over 4,000 nurses from 63 hospitals throughout the United States. We matched this data with audit data on the incidence of pressure injuries among over 21,000 patients on 262 nursing units in 56 survey hospitals. Hospital-acquired pressure injuries are a significant risk to patient health and hospital costs. We do not find support for our hypothesis that workarounds are associated with a higher rate of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. However, when we take into account the moderating role of operational failures on the relationship between workarounds and pressure injuries, we find significant results. When nursing units have lower levels of operational failures, workarounds are associated with higher rates of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. Our results provide evidence that workarounds may be associated with negative patient outcomes, if they stem from a process-avoiding approach. The best results can be achieved by reducing both operational failures and workarounds via instilling a process-focused approach. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.",Article,"['healthcare cost', ' medical error', ' operational failures', ' survey', ' workaroundsHealth risks', ' Nursing', ' Surveying', ' Surveys', ' Health care costs', ' Health care providers', ' Hospital costs', ' Medical errors', ' Operational failures', ' Patient health', ' Quality of care', ' workarounds', ' Hospitals']"

Inlet flow recirculation or backflow in the inducer occurs at low flow conditions and can lead to instabilities and cavitation-induced head breakdown. Backflow of an inducer with a tip clearance (TC) of τ = 0.32% and with no tip clearance (NTC) is examined with a series of computational fluid dynamics simulations. Removing the TC eliminates tip leakage flow; however, backflow is still observed. In fact, the NTC case showed a 37% increase in the length of the upstream backflow penetration. Tip leakage flow does instigate a smaller secondary leading edge tip vortex that is separate from the much larger backflow structure.

Static radiative heat exchangers are often simple and reliable systems but typically cannot be adapted to environmental changes. Adaptable radiative heat exchangers can be adjusted in response to variations in the thermal environment or operating conditions and have the potential for increased efficiency and reduced cost. Dynamic control of a radiative heat exchanger is possible through geometric manipulation of a segmented, self-irradiating fin, consisting of rigid panels that are linked by thermal hinges in an accordion arrangement. In this paper, a numerical model is described to predict the temperature profile and efficiency of a radiative heat exchanger, accounting for conduction and self-irradiation. Governing equations are cast in terms of the conduction-radiation interaction parameter, surface emissivity, actuation angle, and the thermal conductance of the hinges linking the panels. Results indicate that a turn-down ratio (largest possible heat rate divided by smallest possible heat rate) of greater than three is possible for realistic panel geometries and materials. Self-irradiation decreases the turn-down ratio, and there is evidence that an optimal number of rigid panels exists for any combination of panel geometry and device temperature. The maximum efficiency occurs when the plates are in the collapsed position, but the heat rate is at a minimum in this configuration. Finally, the properties and geometry of the plates are shown to have a more significant effect on the turn-down ratio than the properties of the thermal hinges. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,

It does not depend on handcrafted features or manual tuning of parameters and is generalized to be versatile for visual inspection applications. This allows the system to be configured on the fly for different applications and by an operator without extensive experience.

However, most existing image quality assessment (IQA) methods mainly focused on a single type of distortions.

Image distortions not only destroy the intensity of low-level image features, but also alter their distribution, to both of which the human vision system (HVS) is sensitive. Based on these observations, low-level features are represented by phase congruency (PC) which is consistent with human perception. The distribution of low-level features is extracted using local binary pattern (LBP) in PC domain at multiple scales, which can effectively characterize the impact of multiple distortions on images. Given that PC is contrast invariant while the contrast does affect perceptual image quality of the HVS, image gradient magnitude (GM) is employed as a weighting factor for LBP histogram creation. Finally a support vector regression model is trained to map the gradient-weighted LBP histograms in PC domain at multi-scale to quality scores.

If the planned path drifts from the human's intent as a result of environment changes, the path needs to be replanned. This paper presents a replanning framework with three elements: (a) the integration of fast online path-planning algorithms that generate trajectories conforming to the given intent; (b) a mathematical model that says when replanning must happen; and (c) an evaluation of events that trigger replanning. An interactive graphical user interface enables a human to accept or reject replanned paths when a trigger happens.

Data race freedom is a desirable property for task parallel programs but is difficult to prove because every possible execution of the program must be considered. A partial order over events of an observed program execution induces an equivalence class of executions that the program may also produce. The Does-not-Commute (DC) relation is an efficiently computable partial order used for data race detection. As a relatively weak partial order, the DC relation can represent relatively large equivalence classes of program executions. However, some of these executions may be infeasible, thus leading to false data race reports. The contribution of this paper is a mechanized proof that the DC relation is actually sound for commonly used task parallel programming models. Sound means that the first data race identified by the DC relation is guaranteed to be a real data race. A prototype analysis in the Java Pathfinder model checker shows that the DC relation can significantly reduce the number of explored states required to prove data race freedom in Habanero Java programs. In this application, the search for data race using the DC relation is both sound and complete. © 2019 FMCAD Inc.",Conference Paper,

Industry professionals should focus on practices that can improve project team selection, team building, and identifying challenges to the team and project, hence improving alignment. This paper provides a summary of key findings of a national study of transportation projects, identifying current practices of industry professionals for the selection and alignment of project teams for transportation projects. Current team selection practices, the most beneficial team alignment practices, and the greatest challenges to team alignment are identified in the study. These practices are also analyzed and reported by project delivery method, and the results presented in this paper add to the body of knowledge by identifying current alignment practices, successful practices, and challenges specific to each delivery method. Among the findings are that overall project teams are selected primarily based on project experience and ability to meet schedule, regardless of the project delivery method chosen. Successful teams with good alignment were found to be characterized by having established expectations, team trust, honesty within the team, shared values, and good communication. No notable differences were found among delivery methods, demonstrating that the principles of team alignment are not dependent on the project delivery method. Challenges that cause adversarial relationships in the team include issues of constructability, schedule availability, and project complexity. The study also identified transportation-specific alignment challenges such as public involvement. The greatest challenges specific to each delivery method include team coordination for construction manager at risk (CMAR) projects, constructability procedures for design-bid-build projects, and environmental impacts for design-build projects. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,

The results show that the performance of the matching pursuit (MP) algorithms seemed to be better suited to this application in the sense that no additional steps were required and the postequalizer BER of the best MP algorithm was slightly better than that of the other sparse estimation techniques.

While CI-CNTs are only roughly conductive they work well in micro springs, levers, and meshes. However, fabrication of CI-CNTs can result in large mechanical property variation, and methods to characterize properties usually involve destructive testing. Destructive testing also assumes the tested specimens are representative of the entire batch which is not always true in the case of CI-CNT production. Finding a non-destructive way to test for stiffness of this material reduces the number of parts that have to be made and increases confidence in the integrity of device being used. It also simplifies testing of complex parts. The stiffness of CI-CNT beams is related to the molecular structure of the carbon material infiltrated between the carbon nanotubes (CNTs), how it interacts with the CNTs, and how much of it there is. The amount of material can be approximated with the density of the beam, and both the type of material and its interaction with the CNTs can be approximated through analysis of the Raman spectra taken at the surface. A combination of these two observations can be related to the effective material stiffness. The relationship can be fitted with a power function, with a variance of 1.41 GPa, which is about 11% of the maximum stiffness of the samples tested. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Article,"['bending modulus', ' carbon infiltrated-carbon nanotubes', ' carbon nanotubes', ' density', ' non-destructive testing', ' Raman spectroscopyBridge decks', ' Density (specific gravity)', ' MEMS', ' Nondestructive examination', ' Raman spectroscopy', ' Stiffness', ' Bending moduli', ' Carbon material', ' Destructive testing', ' Effective materials', ' Emerging materials', ' Maximum stiffness', ' Micro electromechanical system (MEMS)', ' Non destructive testing', ' Carbon nanotubes']"

An integral analysis of the transport equations resulting in a system of ordinary differential equations was solved numerically. Impingement on superhydrophobic surfaces greatly reduces the heat transfer that occurs relative to a smooth surface due to gas trapped in cavities on the surface. This results in an apparent slip velocity and temperature jump at the surface. Local and average Nusselt numbers are presented as a function of radial position (0 to 45 jet radii), jet Reynolds number (3×103 to 1.5×104), liquid Prandtl number (2 to 11), normalized slip length (0 to 0.2), and normalized temperature jump length (0 to 0.2). All results are compared to classical (no-slip, no temperature jump) behavior on a smooth surface. Although local Nusselt numbers for the isoflux scenario are greater than the corresponding isothermal case, the difference in Nusselt number between these two heating conditions becomes negligible as the temperature jump length increases to quantities realizable on superhydrophobic surfaces.

First, the JND map of the image is computed. The spatial and relative intensity relationships among pixels in a local neighborhood are employed to generate the proposed LBP based on the JND map. Then, image contrast is used as a weighting factor for the LBP histogram generation to characterize the structural and contrast information of the image. Finally, the contrast and structure changes due to image distortion are measured by calculating the similarity between contrast-weighted histograms of the reference and distorted images. Support vector regression is employed to pool the similarity to predict the quality.

Men with ED generally complain failure to attain or maintain an adequate erection during sexual activity. The prevalence of ED is strongly correlated with age, affecting about 40% of men at age 40 and nearly 70% at age 70. A variety of chronic diseases, including diabetes, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, depression, chronic renal failure, obstructive sleep apnea, prostate disease, gout, and sleep disorder, were reported to be associated with ED. In this study, data retrieved from a subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan were used for designing the clinical decision support system (CDSS) for predicting ED incidences in men. The positive cases were male patients aged 20-65 who were diagnosed with ED between January 2000 and December 2010 confirmed by at least three outpatient visits or at least one inpatient visit, while the negative cases were randomly selected from the database without a history of ED and were frequency (1:1), age, and index year matched with the ED patients. Data of a total of 2832 ED patients and 2832 non-ED patients, each consisting of 41 features including index age, 10 comorbidities, and 30 other comorbidity-related variables, were retrieved for designing the predictive models. Integrated genetic algorithm and support vector machine was adopted to design the CDSSs with two experiments of independent training and testing (ITT) conducted to verify their effectiveness. In the 1st ITT experiment, data extracted from January 2000 till December 2005 (61.51%, 1742 positive cases and 1742 negative cases) were used for training and validating and the data retrieved from January 2006 till December 2010 were used for testing (38.49%), whereas in the 2nd ITT experiment, data in the training set (77.78%) were extracted from January 2000 till Deceber 2007 and those in the testing set (22.22%) were retrieved afterward. Tenfold cross validation and three different objective functions were adopted for obtaining the optimal models with best predictive performance in the training phase. The testing results show that the CDSSs achieved a predictive performance with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, g-mean, and area under ROC curve of 74.72%-76.65%, 72.33%-83.76%, 69.54%-77.10%, 0.7468-0.7632, and 0.766-0.817, respectively.

However, LBP-based methods are sensitive to noise, and some structure information represented by non-uniform patterns is lost due to the combination of these patterns. In this paper, a new local structure descriptor based on just noticeable difference (JND) for texture classification is proposed by exploring the spatial and relative intensity correlations among local neighborhood pixels. First, a JND map of the image is computed, and then we attempt to model the correlations among local neighborhood pixels by comparing the absolute differences in intensity between the central pixel and its neighbors with the corresponding JND threshold. A new visual pattern (JNDVP) is designed using modeled correlations to describe image structure. Next, considering that image contrast makes important contributions to structure description, contrast is employed as a weighting factor for JNDVP histogram creation to represent structural and contrast information in a single representation. Finally, the nearest neighborhood classifier is employed for texture classification. Results on two texture image databases demonstrate that the proposed structure descriptor is rotation invariant and more robust to noise than LBP. Moreover, texture classification based on JNDVP outperforms LBP-based methods. © 2019 Optical Society of America.",Article,

Specifically, we developed a simple three-dimensional (3D) laminar micromixer, which distributes the sample stream to a 3D profile to address flow-instability issues caused by Dean vortices in a two-dimensional mixer. In the 3D mixer, the sample stream was successfully focused to a one-pixel width at the resolution of ˜200 nm/pixel, which approached the resolving power of an optical microscope and represented the highest imaging resolution ever achieved using a 3D mixer.

For all aluminas, heat treatment results in decreased surface area and increased pore diameter. Starting at 700 °C, metastable to stable phase transformation occurs, causing a substantial change in the pore structure of all aluminas. By 1100 (PA), 1200 (15 SDA) and 1200 °C (27 SDA), the transition to α-Al2O3 was complete, respectively. No α-Al2O3 is observed for 5 wt % silica doped alumina (5SDA) under thermal calcination. Calcination in steam and air, instead of in air only, results in enlarged pore size and depressed temperature of alpha phase transformation for all aluminas. Results show that the silica dopant modifies the pores of the alumina, stabilizes the oxygen lattice of γ-Al2O3, and retards α-Al2O3 formation.

Creating effective tremor suppression devices requires a knowledge of where tremor originates mechanically (which muscles) and how it propagates through the limb (to which degrees-of-freedom (DOF)). To simulate tremor propagation, we created a simple model of the upper limb, with tremorogenic activity in the 15 major superficial muscles as inputs and tremulous joint displacement in the seven major DOF as outputs. The model approximated the muscle excitation-contraction dynamics, musculoskeletal geometry, and mechanical impedance of the limb. From our simulations, we determined fundamental principles for tremor propagation: (1) The distribution of tremor depends strongly on musculoskeletal dynamics. (2) The spreading of tremor is due to inertial coupling (primarily) and musculoskeletal geometry (secondarily). (3) Tremorogenic activity in a given muscle causes significant tremor in only a small subset of DOF, though these affected DOF may be distant from the muscle. (4) Assuming uniform distribution of tremorogenic activity among muscles, tremor increases proximal-distally, and the contribution from muscles increases proximal-distally. (5) Although adding inertia (e.g., with weighted utensils) is often used to suppress tremor, it is possible to increase tremor by adding inertia to the wrong DOF. (6) Similarly, adding viscoelasticity to the wrong DOF can increase tremor. Based solely on the musculoskeletal system, these principles indicate that tremor treatments targeting muscles should focus first on the distal muscles, and devices targeting DOF should focus first on the distal DOF. © 2019 by ASME.",Article,

This paper introduces an improved synthetic basis feature descriptor algorithm that describes and compares image features in an efficient and discrete manner with rotation and scale invariance. It works by performing a number of similarity tests between the feature region surrounding the feature point and a predetermined number of synthetic basis images to generate a feature descriptor that uniquely describes the feature region. Features in two images are matched by comparing their descriptors. By only storing the similarity of the feature region to each synthetic basis image, the overall storage size is greatly reduced. In short, this new binary feature descriptor is designed to provide high feature matching accuracy with computational simplicity, relatively low resource usage, and a hardware friendly design for real-time vision applications. Experimental results show that our algorithm produces higher precision rates and larger number of correct matches than the original version and other mainstream algorithms and is a good alternative for common computer vision applications.

This special edition synthesizes observations related to structural and foundation performance, and the corresponding damage patterns, carried out by two UNAM-GEER engineering reconnaissance teams sent to investigate the geotechnical earthquake engineering aspects of this event. Articles were solicited of researchers that were in the field that investigated: the characteristics of the event, the demand and damage distribution across Mexico City and surrounding regions, the seismic performance of buildings, lifelines, and other critical infrastructure, considering the site response and soil-structure interaction effects in the observed damage distribution. Special attention was paid to the impact of regional ground subsidence, in the seismic-soil structure interaction exhibited by the affected building. Advanced non-intrusive survey methods were used to map damage patterns in a regional level. Comparisons were made between the observed building damage patterns following the September 19th, 1985 Michoacan earthquake, and the 2017 Puebla-Mexico City earthquake, and the distinct differences in the damage distribution between the two earthquakes were revised. Overall, building and foundation performance were observed to be quite good during the 2017 event, especially when compared to the 1985 event. Structures that were observed to be heavily damaged or collapsed were all built prior to 1985, and incorporated poor structural design and/or construction, which resonated with the soil column on which they were constructed, and/or were built upon very soft soils that contributed to significant foundation deformations.

Further, by collecting one observation every 12 minutes, rather than a subgroup of five every hour, the time-weighted charts of individual values result in a shorter ATS (average time to signal) than would be possible using Shewhart charts of subgrouped data. This article explores a similar strategy of monitoring process variability using time-weighted control charts and individual observations. The average time to signal a change in variability using these charts is studied when there are targets or known values for the in-control process mean and standard deviation. The results show that the ATS of both the Cusum and EWMA are substantially shorter than the ATS for the standard R charts or the more efficient S2 chart using subgroups of 5. The article also describes how the control limits for the EWMA chart to monitor process variability should be modified if the in-control process mean and standard deviations are unknown and must be estimated from a Phase I study.

This poses a problem when an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is tracking multiple ground targets on a road network larger than its field of view. We propose a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) to maintain individual target tracks and to perform probabilistic data association when the targets are constrained to a road network. This is particularly useful when a target leaves then re-enters the UAV's field of view. The RBPF is structured as a particle filter of particle filters. The top level filter handles data association and each of its particles maintains a bank of particle filters to handle target tracking. The tracking particle filters incorporate both positive and negative information when a measurement is received. We then implement a receding horizon controller to improve the filter certainty of multiple target locations. The controller prioritizes searching for targets based on the entropy of each target's estimate. © 2019 American Automatic Control Council.,Conference Paper,

Following PWHT at 607 °C for 20 hours, the carbon-enriched zone exhibited little to no reduction in hardness although 20 pct hardness reduction occurred in the remainder of the first butter layer.

In industrial inspection, it is important to collect the most relevant data to keep processing demands, both human and computational, to a minimum. This study investigates the viability of automated targeted multi-scale image acquisition for Structure from Motion (SfM)-based infrastructure modeling. A traditional view-planning approach for SfM is extended to a multi-scale approach, planning for targeted regions of high, medium, and low priority. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can traverse the entire aerial space and facilitates collection of an optimized set of views, both close to and far away from areas of interest. The test case for field validation is the Tibble Fork Dam in Utah. Using the targeted multi-scale flight planning, a UAV automatically flies a tiered inspection using less than 25% of the number of photos needed to model the entire dam at high-priority level. This results in approximately 75% reduced flight time and model processing load, while still maintaining high model accuracy where needed. Models display stepped improvement in visual clarity and SfM reconstruction integrity by priority level, with the higher priority regions more accurately modeling smaller and finer features.

The system was trained to recognize the seven gestures and then tested in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation. The system was able to identify all gestures with an overall accuracy of 90% and with five of the seven gestures being accurately identified at least 94% of the time.

We explore how students' audience awareness is facilitated by the case method, which presents students with a professional communication task within a workplace scenario. Situating the case: Case-method research suggests including a detailed audience and situation, multiple genres, and multimedia. Few studies have explored how case materials facilitate students' audience awareness. About the case: A 12-week case that was consistent with case-method research asked students to respond to an engineering firm's internal problem with a proposal and report. How the case was studied: Students from two sections of a genre-based course completed reflections about their audience awareness after the proposal and report. We qualitatively analyzed 51 reflections. Results/discussion: Students stated they could understand the facts about their primary audience but couldn't identify secondary and tertiary audiences. Students stated they could identify audience needs, but they disagreed about the amount of detail to understand those needs. Also, students stated they could respond to the audience using appropriate evidence and writing style. Conclusions: When using the case method, instructors should know that students may need varying levels of detail to interpret their audience's needs. Also, including data and conflicting needs gives students opportunities to make strategic decisions about content. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Article,"['Audience awareness', ' case-method', ' pedagogy', ' report and proposal writingComputer aided instruction', ' Computer aided software engineering', ' Education', ' Employment', ' Technical writing', ' Audience awareness', ' Case method', ' pedagogy', ' Proposal writing', ' Proposals', ' Students']"

The ABC employed were recently devised by Villamizar et al. (2017). They are derived from exact Farfield Expansions representations of the outgoing waves in the exterior of the regions enclosed by the artificial boundary. As a consequence, the error due to the ABC on the artificial boundary can be reduced conveniently such that the dominant error comes from the volume discretization method used in the interior of the computational domain. Reciprocally, the error in the interior can be made as small as the error at the artificial boundary by appropriate implementation of p- and h-refinement. We apply this novel method to cylindrical, spherical and arbitrary shape scatterers including a prototype submarine. Our numerical results exhibit spectral-like approximation and high order convergence rate. Additionally, they show that the proposed method can reduce both the pollution and artificial boundary errors to negligible levels even in very low- and high-frequency regimes with rather coarse discretization densities in the IGA.

Using data from a large campus district energy system, equipped with centralized chilled water plants and a thermal energy storage tank, a novel technique is proposed to optimize this system in real-time, formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem. This method, titled Quadratic Programming Hybrid with Augmented Constraints, is sufficiently fast to be computed in real-time for a district chiller system. This method is compared to both Branch and Bound and a simple logical decision algorithm in both speed and optimality. The proposed method for solving this mixed-integer quadratic programming problem proves very successful at achieving a near-optimal solution when compared to a standard Branch and Bound (BnB) algorithm. Although suboptimal, the proposed algorithm takes 99.96–99.99% less computational time than the standard BnB and computes an answer to within 29.9% of the BnB objective function. When compared to a simple logical decision algorithm, which represents an operator manually controlling the plant, the proposed method is estimated to yield 8.10–33.7% in savings on chiller energy costs.

Typically, the allograft acts as a scaffold to guide tissue regeneration with superior biocompatibility relative to synthetic scaffolds. Traditionally these scaffolds are machined into the required dimensions and shapes. However, the geometrical simplicity and, in some cases, limited dimensions of the donated tissue restrict the use of allograft scaffolds. This could be overcome by additive manufacturing using granulated bone that is both decellularized and demineralized. In this study, the large area projection sintering (LAPS) method is evaluated as a fabrication method to build porous structures composed of granulated cortical bone bound by polycaprolactone (PCL). This additive manufacturing method utilizes visible light to selectively cure the deposited material layer-by-layer to create 3D geometry. First, the spreading behavior of the composite mixtures is evaluated and the conditions to attain improved powder bed density to fabricate the test specimens are determined. The tensile strength of the LAPS fabricated samples in both dry and hydrated states are determined and compared to the demineralized cancellous bone allograft and the heat treated demineralized-bone/PCL mixture in mold. The results indicated that the projection sintered composites of 45–55 wt %.

Beyond the baseline combined framework, the new model tracks sets of neighboring grains and allows twin transmission between them under certain conditions. The influence of grain boundary (GB) character is included in the stochastic models of twin nucleation and transmission. The starting texture from a rolled magnesium alloy AZ31B sheet was obtained using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) for initial input into the NVPSC. The sample was further deformed by uniaxial compression to encourage twin formation and the corresponding texture information was collected using EBSD. The accuracy of simulated twin activity was determined by comparing it with the twin activity seen in the deformed sample. The total number of predicted twins and the number of transmission twins is found to agree favorably with those observed via the EBSD scans.

The observed damage was mostly due to site affects originated by the high plastiCity clay deposits found in the basin, which lead to large amplifications, and duration elongation of the ground motions coming from the epicenter. In addition, a frequency content modification occurs, which in turn, leads to a double resonance effect between the incoming ground motions, soil deposits, and the damaged buildings. Exactly 32 years after this devastating event, the Mw 7.1 09/19/2017 normal fault earthquake, reminded us of the importance of accounting for site effects, and most importantly the need to carry out a proper characterization of basin geometry, soil profile configuration, hydraulic conditions, and maintenance-structure periodic assessments of the building stock in Mexico City.

Standard AM processes such as extrusion can produce substrates on which electrical traces can be deposited. However, the surface roughness of plastic extrusion reduces the effective electrical conductivity and can introduce anisotropy, especially in radio frequency (RF) devices. The roughness can be reduced using vapor smoothing (VS), but solvent absorption changes the surface composition slightly, can be environmentally hazardous, and is not feasible with all thermoplastics. A new method introduced here - coined thermal smoothing (TS) - utilizes a heat source to locally reflow the material, thus minimizing the roughness of the undulating surfaces without the drawbacks of VS. This research work compares the surface roughness impacts of both smoothing processes with profilometry and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Both smoothing processes significantly reduce the surface roughness of extruded components by 80% and 90% for TS and VS, respectively.

Computer vision technology is being viewed as an effective tool for automatic food recognition for monitoring nutrition intake. Of the many food recognition algorithms in the literature, Bag-of-Features model is a proven approach that has shown impressive recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a small and efficient convolutional neural network architecture for Chinese food recognition, which is more applicable for resources limited platforms. Our network architecture is designed to model and perform a pipeline of processing similar to the Bag-of-Features approach. The main advantage of the proposed architecture, like other convolutional neural networks, is its ability to unifiedly optimize the entire network through back propagation, which is critical to recognition accuracy. We further compare and correlate our architecture with the traditional Bag-of-Features model in an attempt to investigate the similarities between them and identify factors that influence the recognition accuracy. The proposed architecture with a 5-layer deep convolutional neural network achieves the top-1 accuracy of 97.12% and the top-5 accuracy of 99.86% on a newly created Chinese food image dataset that is composed of 8734 images of 25 food categories.

In this paper, the transfer matrix method is combined with D'Alembert's principle to develop a two-port dynamic stiffness model for analyzing the kinetostatics and dynamics of complex compliant mechanisms with serial-parallel configurations. In detail, two kinds of improved transfer matrices for parallel sub-chains are derived in a unified form by summarizing the common serial-parallel substructures in compliant mechanisms. Then, a two-port dynamic stiffness model describing the frequency-dependent input and output force-displacement relationship of compliant mechanisms is established. Based on the two-port dynamic stiffness model, procedures for solving the static and dynamic performances of compliant mechanisms are presented. The proposed approach is demonstrated by calculating the displacement amplification ratio, input/output stiffness, natural frequencies and forced dynamic response of two typical precision flexure manipulators. The advantage of the proposed approach lies in its capability to describe the simultaneous kinetostatics and dynamics for a large class of serial-parallel configurations with very few degrees of freedom (DOFs), differing from the previous Lagrange-based dynamic modeling methods in the context of compliant mechanisms and should be of interest to designers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"['Compliant mechanisms', ' Dynamic stiffness matrix', ' Flexure hinge', ' Micro-/nano positioningCompliant mechanisms', ' Degrees of freedom (mechanics)', ' Hinges', ' Mechanisms', ' Stiffness', ' Stiffness matrix', ' Transfer matrix method', "" D' Alembert's principle"", ' Degrees of freedom (DoFs)', ' Displacement amplification', ' Dynamic stiffness matrix', ' Flexure hinge', ' Frequency dependent', ' Micro/nano positioning', ' Static and dynamic performance', ' Dynamics']"

This is a critical problem for most open-chain agents that more readily transmetallate in vivo, in comparison to macrocyclic compounds. Gadolinium diethylene tri-aminepentaacetic acid bis-glucosamide (Gd-DTPA-BIGA) is an experimental, open-chain contrast agent which has a significantly increased relaxivity coefficient in comparison to other GBCAs. This results in greater signal intensity and improved contrast enhancement. These superior imaging qualities initiated a search for a solution to the transmetallation of this agent. Plasma zinc is a well-known GBCA transmettalation agent. Since the base chelate of Gadodiamide (Gd-DPTA-Bis-Methylamide or Omniscan), DTPA-Bis-Methylamide (DTPA-BMA), readily transmettalates with and binds serum zinc, we hypothesized that a plasma “zinc sink,” may significantly reduce transmetallation of linear agents. 5% DTPA-BMA was added to a formulation of Gd-DTPA-BIGA, which was tested against the original formulation of Gd-DTPA-BIGA with 0.2% of the base chelate DTPA-BIGA. These formulations, including gadodiamide, were labeled with 153 GdCl 3 followed by infusion into cohorts of Sprague Dawley rats which were sacrificed at 1, 30 and 60 days. Internal organs were harvested, along with blood, skin and femur, and analyzed for residual gadolinium. A subset of tissues were also interrogated with ICP-MS. Labeled Gadodiamide and saline where used as controls. Conclusion: The addition of 5% DTPA-BMA, as a zinc binding agent, reduced the transmetallation of the linear agent Gd-DTPA-BIGA, in comparison to its original formulation supplemented with 0.2% BIGA. This result indicates that supplementing linear GBCAs with ancillary chelates may hold promise for reducing, or eliminating the biological archiving of gadolinium in tissues.

Despite the World Anti-Doping Agency's ban on such practices, ABT abuse continues. Autologous blood doping (ABD) is challenging to detect because of the similarities between an individual's doped and undoped blood. Recently, Harrison et al. reported that high-speed capillary electrophoresis may identify ABD. In their work, first order derivatives of the electropherograms were used to identify doping. However, this method suffered from false negatives due to the subjective nature of the analysis. Here, we provide an informatics analysis of the data from this study, contrasting the results of traditional statistical methods and less traditional mathematical techniques. First, three well-known multivariate statistical tools: cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and partial least squares (PLS) are applied to develop calibrations and/or group electropherograms of undoped (0%) and doped (5% and 10%) blood samples. (These doping levels were chosen due to the low physiological effect of doping below 5%, with 10% corresponding to the approximate ‘gain' derived from the transfusion of a single unit of blood into an adult.) Different preprocessing and variable selection methods were considered. Due to variation in the electropherograms and the limited sample size, these methods were inadequate. We next considered four less commonly used mathematical/informatics tools: pattern recognition entropy (PRE), the Euclidean distance between vectors, a peak fitting/integration method, and the second moment (SM). Each of these techniques showed some ability to differentiate between the 0, 5, and 10% doped samples. We then evaluated the prediction capabilities of inverse least squares (ILS) models based on these summary statistics. An ILS calibration based on PRE, the Euclidean distance, and peak fitting/integration proved more successful than the PLS model at predicting levels of blood doping from the corresponding electropherograms; the ILS model distinguished between doped (5% and 10%) and undoped (0%) blood. This methodology may be applicable to other challenging informatics problems like determining risk factors for genetically linked diseases, robust pattern finding in peak-like data such as ChIP-seq, or other genomic sequencing for understanding the 3D genome. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Article,

Specifically, the safety and efficiency of several collision-avoidance mechanisms under different possible densities, accelerations, and action distances were investigated. The results suggest that selecting appropriate action distances and collision-avoidance mechanisms will be vital to maintaining safety and efficiency. Interestingly, excessive action distances quickly degrade performance: using a simple method under high-density conditions (1 UAV∕km2), well-clear distances above approximately 750 m have extremely low efficiency (∼1% as many deliveries accomplished in 5000 simulation hours compared to lower distances). More advanced algorithms also suffer from low efficiency at higher (∼1 km) response distances.

The purpose of this study was to explore the ability of Losartan to inhibit the inflammatory signaling pathway of TGF-β1 observed during osteoarthritic progression in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and knee joint using a genetic mouse model. Methods: A murine OA model displaying the heterozygous chondrodysplasia gene (cho/+), a col11a1 mutation, was used to test this hypothesis. Following a 7-month treatment period with Losartan, the synovial joints were analyzed for histopathological improvement comparing two experimental groups. Tissues were fixed in paraformaldehyde, processed to paraffin section, and stained with Safranin O and Fast Green to visualize proteoglycans and collagen proteins in cartilage. Using the Modified Mankin scoring system, the degree of staining and OA progression were evaluated. Results: Results show heterozygous animals receiving Losartan having diminished degeneration of TMJ condylar and knee joint articular cartilage. This was confirmed in the TMJ and knee by a statistically significant decrease in the Mankin histopathology score. Decreased expression of HtrA1, a key regulator to the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, was demonstrated in vitro as well as in vivo, via Losartan inhibition.

Three different compressive strengths of mortar, grout, and concrete masonry units were used. Grouts were made without and with a shrinkage-compensating admixture. The various components were combined to construct several hollow and grouted prisms, which were then tested. The results show that very high-strength blocks were not as efficient as medium-strength blocks and that there was a difference between the compressive strengths of ungrouted and grouted masonry; depending on the combination of the materials used, grouted masonry can be less or more efficient than ungrouted masonry. For one combination of materials, the shrinkage-compensating admixture was shown to be effective in reducing the grout shrinkage, and the grouted prisms constructed with that combination of materials were more efficient than their hollow prisms counterpart. Grouted prisms constructed with grouts without the shrinkage-compensating admixture were, on average, less efficient than hollow prisms. The efficiency of grouted masonry depends on many factors including compatibility of deformation between the masonry components, compaction of the grout, shrinkage characteristics of the grout, block geometry, and bond between grout and block.

The apparatus developed in this research included an impactor unit, a moving platform, a microphone for air-coupled sensing, a distance measurement instrument, and signal processing modules. Given the absence of an existing universal threshold for differentiating among intact and delaminated areas using the new device, a delamination detection threshold value was determined in a first field demonstration also involving chain dragging and coring of a concrete bridge deck. While the maps of the air-coupled impact-echo data and chain-dragging data exhibit a high degree of similarity and are highly consistent with the results of coring, a quantitative method of comparison also demonstrates the utility of the new device across a broad range of delamination percentages. Specifically, the results indicate that the percentage of the deck area determined to be delaminated using impact-echo testing was within 3 percentage points of that determined to be delaminated using chain dragging for 10 of the 13 deck test sections, which generally exhibited delamination percentages ranging from 7 to 21%.

An analytical model is presented and compared to synthetic schlieren experiments of two Gaussian-shaped topographies.

In order to study the embrittlement and recovery of steel, tensile tests were conducted on two different types of AHSS over time after hydrogen charging. Concentration measurements and hydrogen microprinting were carried out at the same time steps to visualize the hydrogen behavior during recovery. The diffusible hydrogen concentration was found to decay exponentially, and empirical relations were found for both types of steel. Hydrogen concentration decay rates were determined to be -0.355 /hr in TBF-980, and -0.225 /hr in DP-980. Hydrogen concentration thresholds for embrittlement were found to be 1.04 mL/100 g for TBF, and 0.87 mL/100 g for DP steel. TBF steel is predicted to recover from embrittlement within 4.2 h, compared to 7.2 h in DP steel. A two-factor method of evaluating recovery from embrittlement, requiring hydrogen concentration threshold and decay rate, is explained for use in predicting recovery after exposure to hydrogen. Anisotropic hydrogen diffusion rates were also observed on the surface of both steels for a short time after charging, as hydrogen left the surface through <001> and <101> grains faster than grains with <111> orientations.

This work explores the impact of a changing projected surface area and varying apparent radiative properties on the net radiative heat transfer of an accordion fold comprised of V-grooves. The net radiative heat transfer of an accordion tessellation is obtained by a thermal energy balance at the cavity openings with radiative properties of the cavities given as a function of various cavity parameters. Results of the analytical model are experimentally confirmed. An accordion tessellation, constructed of stainless-steel shim stock, is positioned to achieve a specified fold angle and placed in a vacuum environment while heated by Joule heating. A thermal camera records the apparent temperature of the cavity openings for various fold angles. Results are compared to apparent temperatures predicted with the analytical model. Analytically and experimentally obtained temperatures agree within 5% and all measurements fall within experimental uncertainty. For diffusely irradiated surfaces, the decrease in projected surface area dominates, causing a continuous decrease in net radiative heat transfer for a collapsing accordion fold. Highly reflective specular surfaces exposed to diffuse irradiation experience large turn-down ratios (7.5× reduction in heat transfer) in the small angle ranges. Specular surfaces exposed to collimated irradiation achieve a turn down ratio of 3.35 between V-groove angles of 120 deg and 150 deg.

All surfaces tested were submerged in a 20 mm deep pool of water and heated from below to maintain a constant surface temperature, while the side walls of the pool were insulated, and the top was covered. Three thermocouples positioned in the pool obtain the average pool temperature. A heat flux sensor is placed directly beneath the surface to measure the heat flux supplied to the pool. Free convection heat transfer coefficients are obtained for the sub-boiling temperature range of 40–90 °C. Six surface types are studied: smooth hydrophilic, smooth hydrophobic, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures and additional sparsely spaced ribs to close off the cavities, circular posts, and circular holes. It is found that structured superhydrophobic surfaces provide cavities for nucleation to occur. More dissolved air effervesces from the water as the surface temperature increases due to an increased level of supersaturation and convection. The nucleation leads to large air bubble formations that reduce the overall convection coefficient when compared to the smooth surfaces. For the rib/cavity structured surfaces, the bubbles form in an anisotropic manner and are aligned with the surface structure. More bubbles are observed on the superhydrophobic surfaces where the cavities are bounded. Since water's ability to dissolve air is dependent on temperature, heat and mass transfer cannot be treated independently on any of the superhydrophobic surfaces studied here. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"['Heat transfer', ' Mass transfer', ' Natural convection', ' Nucleation', ' SuperhydrophobicAtmospheric temperature', ' Heat flux', ' Heat transfer', ' Lakes', ' Mass transfer', ' Microstructure', ' Natural convection', ' Nucleation', ' Surface properties', ' Surface structure', ' Thermocouples', ' Air bubble formation', ' Constant surface temperatures', ' Convection coefficients', ' Heat and mass transfer', ' Structured surfaces', ' Super-hydrophobic surfaces', ' Superhydrophobic', ' Surface temperatures', ' Hydrophobicity']"

To better understand how these efforts might increase CS education for all, we surveyed every public school in the state of Utah and analyzed enrollment data for all 19 Utah CS courses. The survey consisted of closed and open-ended questions about each school's current CS practices and personnel. Schools from 39 of 42 public school districts responded (including charter schools) representing 46.3% of the state's high schools, 39.3% of middle/junior high schools, and 28% of elementary schools. Course data indicated that enrollment in CS courses increased considerably in the past five years after the introduction of newer, more fundamental courses.

The ultimate goal of this research is to develop ROMs that have sufficient accuracy and low computational cost so that these upscaling simulations can be readily performed. However, constructing ROMs for these complex simulations presents its own challenge. Here, we present and compare four different approaches for reduced-order modeling of brittle crack propagation in geomaterials. These methods rely on machine learning (ML) and graph-theoretic algorithms to approximate key aspects of the brittle crack problem. These methods also incorporate different physics-based assumptions in order to reduce the training requirements while maintaining accurate physics as much as possible. Results from the ROMs are directly compared against a high-fidelity model of brittle crack propagation. Further, the strengths and weaknesses of the ROMs are discussed, and we conclude that combining smart physics-informed feature engineering with highly trainable ML models provides the best performance.

In this approach, we propose the use of static, laser-induced, grating structures within the device substrate to break the leaky mode light into diffracted orders. We then propose to use carefully timed illumination pulses to select which diffracted order is visible to the eye at every display refresh interval (up to 100 kHz). Each of these orders becomes a view for a different image point. To describe this new method, we use K-vector analysis. We give the relevant equations and a list of parameters which lead to a near-eye geometry with little or no overlap in higher-order view zones. We conclude that it should be possible to increase the field of view of our bottom-exit, leaky mode devices by as much as one order of magnitude by simply adding a laser-induced grating structure to the substrate and by carefully timing the device illumination. If successful, this method would make possible a transparent, holographic, near-eye display that is simple to fabricate, relative to pixelated approaches, and which has a wide field-of-view relative to our current bottom-exit displays. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,

The optimized flight path is obtained by using nonlinear model predictive control to solve flight and energy system dynamics over a 24 hour period with a 15 second time resolution. The optimization objective is to maximize the total energy in the system while flying a station-keeping mission, staying within a 3 km radius and above 60,000 ft.

It uses a combination of blade element momentum theory, blade composite structures, empirical motor and motor controller mass data, as well as a first order motor performance model.

Time-accurate, full annulus simulations were carried out to capture and analyze the processes leading to stall inception for uniform inlet conditions. Unsteady interaction between tip clearance flow and the detached normal shock inside of the blade passages became more prevalent at flow rates close to stall, and this unsteadiness likely provides a way for leading edge spillage to occur and initiate the stall process. Although reversed flow at the trailing edge plane was not observed to be more prevalent in simulations near stall than in simulations away from stall, the phenomenon was shown to occur in blade passages that were approaching a stall cell.

We surveyed course participants mid-semester asking students about their personal Instagram use, the value and purpose they felt Instagram had in the course, and on the usefulness of the presentation templates. We learned that while the majority of students use Instagram in their daily life, few of them make comments on personal or course posts and will only do so for credit. We also learned that while students might not enjoy using Instagram in the course, they find it of value and highly meaningful. Finally, the students prefer using formatted templates over an open style like PowerPoint to build their presentations in. These templates enabled the students to post their full presentations and created a visual cohesiveness for the account while providing a rudimentary search process for individual posts.

This study is inspired by existing play studies that continue to demonstrate the positive relationship between the freedom to be playful and psychological wellbeing. The methods used in this study include a consolidation of 99 anonymous free-response student surveys over the course of six semesters that are organised in terms of stress level and frustration word indicators. These comments provide a historical baseline for understanding the student perceptions of their classroom learning experience as it relates to their emotional wellbeing. We then compare those comments with comments made after a semester of playful interventions to discover how they differ. The results indicate that levels of “stress” and “frustration” were decreased with playful interventions, however students spent more hours outside of class lecture on their assignments and the overall student course rating nominally decreased. These results are discussed as well as how pedagogical changes to traditional classroom environments such as this may not only impact stress and frustration but also significantly contribute to the holistic learning experience for university students. © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

We have observed that in successful teams, the education and skills of team members matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work and view their contributions. We believe that there are distinct and innate differences between students in different academic disciplines when it comes to moral positions and these differences in worldview inherently causes friction in interdisciplinary teams. Consequently, we feel that if students could understand these differences extrinsically, they could potentially improve their experience within their interdisciplinary team work. We ran a pilot study with students from Brigham Young University comparing the industrial design, engineering and entrepreneurship majors using The Moral Foundations Questionnaire (Graham, Haidt & Nosek, 2008) This survey measures five facets of one’s moral position: Care/Harm, Fairness/Reciprocity, In-group/Loyalty, Authority/Respect and Sanctity/Purity. Results show that designers scored higher in liberal values than their more conservative leaning engineering and business student counterparts. These results support our hypothesis. Understanding the fundamental value differences between disciplinary training should reduce friction and enhance interdisciplinary team communication. This ability to appreciate other mindsets in order to communicate and effectively design with individuals from differing disciplines will be an “essential skill for workers in the coming decades” (Colombo and Grilli, 2005). © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

A simplified geometry with a vertical coal hopper feeding into a 0.635-cm diameter horizontal pipe was used to represent key elements of the feed system. Coal particles were transported with 20-atm CO2 gas. The feed system was required to maintain a steady flow of gas and solids at a coal flow rate of approximately 3.8 g/s and a CO2 to coal mass ratio in the range 1-2. Sensitivity of model results to mesh size and particle interaction sub-model settings was assessed. Two design concepts were evaluated. A gravity-fed concept was found to be infeasible due to inadequate coal flow rates even at very high CO2 to coal flow ratios. This was due to gravitational forces being insufficient to move the pressurized coal from the hopper into the CO2 stream at the desired rate. A fluidized bed concept was found to provide the desired coal flow rate and CO2 to coal flow ratio. CO2 injected at the hopper base first fluidized the vertical coal bed before transporting it through a horizontal exit pipe. A second CO2 inlet downstream of the hopper exit pipe was used to dilute the fluidized coal and increase pipe velocities to minimize coal drop out. The amount of coal transported from the hopper was dependent on the net CO2 hopper flow but independent of the CO2 dilution flow. This meant that the coal flow rate and CO2 to coal flow ratio could be controlled independently. Pipe exit coal flow rates were found to fluctuate at levels acceptable for steady burner operation.

This is especially true for encryption because the cost of mistakes can be disastrous. Nevertheless, until now, mental models of encryption have only been tangentially explored as part of more broadly focused studies. In this work, we present the first directed effort at exploring user perceptions of encryption: both mental models of what encryption is and how it works as well as views on its role in everyday life. We performed 19 semi-structured phone interviews with participants across the United States, using both standard interview techniques and a diagramming exercise where participants visually demonstrated their perception of the encryption process. We identified four mental models of encryption which, though varying in detail and complexity, ultimately reduce to a functional abstraction of restrictive access control and naturally coincide with a model of symmetric encryption. Additionally, we find the impersonal use of encryption to be an important part of participants' models of security, with a widespread belief that encryption is frequently employed by service providers to encrypt data at rest. In contrast, the personal use of encryption is viewed as reserved for illicit or immoral activity, or for the paranoid. © 2018 by The USENIX Association All Rights Reserved.",Conference Paper,

We propose to measure tremor in clinical settings using the Leap Motion Controller (LMC), which is a markerless motion capture sensor that has a low cost, zero set-up time, and dynamic accuracy of 1.2 mm. However, the frequency response of the LMC has not been characterized, so its ability to track oscillations such as tremor is unknown. To characterize the frequency response of the LMC, we measured the position of a mannequin hand simultaneously with the LMC and a high-resolution encoder while the mannequin hand oscillated at various combinations of frequency (1–15 Hz) and amplitudes (0.01–30 mm). We calculated the magnitude ratio and phase shift of the LMC and found the bandwidth of the LMC to range from 0–3 Hz to 0–5 Hz for tremor amplitudes greater than the dynamic accuracy. This bandwidth is too small to accurately measure most tremors. However, we developed an inverse filter to estimate the actual tremor amplitude and phase despite the limited bandwidth. Over the combinations of frequency and amplitude mentioned above, the inverse filter estimated the actual tremor amplitude and phase with errors of 3% and 2%, respectively. © 2018",Article,"['Frequency response', ' Leap motion controller', ' Markerless motion capture', ' TremorBandwidth', ' Controllers', ' Motion control', ' Clinical settings', ' Dynamic accuracies', ' High resolution', ' Leap motions', ' Limited bandwidth', ' Markerless motion capture', ' Movement disorders', ' Tremor', ' Frequency response', ' Article', ' bandwidth', ' data processing', ' inverse filter', ' leap motion controller', ' oscillation', ' priority journal', ' tremor', ' biomechanics', ' movement (physiology)', ' pathophysiology', ' tremor', ' Biomechanical Phenomena', ' Movement', ' Tremor']"

Given the fact that coded systems tend to operate at lower signal-to-noise ratios than uncoded systems, the synchronizer must operate at these lower signal-to-noise ratios. For a 30 kHz frequency offset and a 10 Mbit/s 16-APSK signal, the conventional phase lock loop (PLL) system does not achieve consistent lock to be a useful approach. Consequently, a blind feed-forward approach, based on the FFT, and an initialized feedback approach based on the PLL were examined. The feed-forward estimator is capable of achieving BER ideal performance for Eb/N0 ≥ 6 dB using 1024 symbols. The feedback estimator, initialized using a feed-forward estimate based on 1024 symbols is also capable of achieving BER ideal performance for Eb/N0 ≥ 6 dB.

The origami stability integration method (OSIM) presented in this paper provides an approach for graphically combining various techniques to achieve stability. Techniques are divided into four groups based on whether they are intrinsic or extrinsic to the origami pattern and whether they exhibit differentiable or non-differentiable energy storage behaviors. These categorizations can help designers select appropriate techniques for their application. The paper also contains design considerations and resources for several intrinsic techniques. Finally, two case studies are presented which use the OSIM and the technique guidelines to conceptualize stability in origami-based devices. Copyright © 2019 ASME.",Conference Paper,

Regional-sandwiching of the compliant sheet is used to create mountain/valley assignments for each fold about a vertex, constraining motion to a single branch of folding. Strain energy in deflected flexible members is used to enable self-deployment. This work presents the methods to design origami-based mechanisms using the ReCS technique, including volume trimming at the vertex of the compliant sheet and of the panels used in the sandwich. Physical models of a simple single fold mechanism and a degree-four vertex mechanism are presented to demonstrate the ReCS technique using acrylic panels and spring steel. Consideration is given to the risk of yielding of the compliant sheet due to parasitic motion with possible mitigation of yielding by decreasing the thickness of the sheet.

The course is offered as a study abroad program where faculty lead a group of students across several countries to learn about global product development. This is accomplished in a 2-3 week time period consisting of visits to companies and universities as well as participation in cultural activities. While much research has been done on the benefits of study abroad, it remains unclear how effective study abroad programs are at helping engineering students, especially short-term study abroad programs. The purpose of this paper is to present and examine the benefits of a short-term, study abroad program to engineering students. Data was collected from students who have taken the Global Product Development Course over the past 15 years in a mixed methods survey. Trends show that technical and cultural visits positively effect engineering students in their perception of global product development. It is also shown that a short, 2-3 week, engineering study abroad program can be as or more effective than traditional study abroad programs in certain areas.

In this paper two categories of kirigami-based models are presented for stopping the fold motion of individual creases using deployable hard stops. These models are transcrease (across a crease) and deploy from a flat sheet. The first category is planar and has behavior similar to a four-bar linkage. The second category is spherical and behaves like a degree-4 origami vertex. These models are based on the zero-thickness assumption of paper and can be applied to origami patterns made from thin materials, limiting the motion of the base origami pattern through self-interference within the original facets. Model parameters are based on a desired fold or dihedral angle, as well as facet dimensions. Examples show model benefits and limitations. Copyright © 2019 ASME.",Conference Paper,

Arrays of silicon lances were made using photolithographic and STS DRIE Bosch techniques. A nanoinjector device was also made to accept the silicon lance arrays and perform nanoinjections. Nanoinjections were performed on Arabidopsis and cotton cotyledons. Changes in the force applied during a nanoinjection and varying the number of repeated nanoinjections on the same cotyledon were observed. Too much force or too many repeated injections caused physical damage to the cotyledon. An optimal force and number of repeated injections can be performed without causing physical damage to the cotyledon. Several injections using DNA were performed without successful transfection of the leaves. Possible reasons for this failure to transfect were explored. Copyright © 2019 ASME.,Conference Paper,

Most existing methods for evaluating social impact indicators require direct human interaction with users of a product, such as one-on-one interviews. These interactions produce high-fidelity data that are rich in information but provide only a single snapshot in time of the product’s impacts and are less frequently collected due to the significant human resources and cost associated with obtaining them. A framework is proposed that describes how low-fidelity data passively obtained using remote sensors, satellites, and digital technology can be collected and correlated with high-fidelity, low-frequency data using machine learning. Using this framework provides an inexpensive way to continuously monitor the social impact indicators of products by augmenting high-fidelity, low-frequency data with low-fidelity, continuously-collected data using machine learning. We illustrate an application of this framework by demonstrating how it can be used to examine the gender-related social impact indicators of water pumps in Uganda. The provided example uses a deep learning model to correlate pump handle movement (measured via an integrated motion unit) with user type (man, woman, or child) of 1,200 hand pump users.

The model demonstrates that the design is capable of staying in motion with continual input pressure (up to at least a time stamp of 1 second), and that an average power output of 9.47 µW over 5 ms can be achieved. We suggest that further research be done to optimize the design parameters and that the optimized design be used to the test the system. Copyright © 2019 ASME.",Conference Paper,

Mechanical hand pumps have a long history of helping people access clean ground water for drinking and daily use. Among the most ubiquitous are the India Mark II and III pump systems, for which there are more than 4,000,000 installed across the world. These are estimated to serve between 600M and 1B people. All pumps degrade in performance over time, requiring service; many do not receive it causing pumps to become dysfunctional. The purpose of this paper is to establish a baseline for nitrile seal performance of India Mark II hand pump systems. Understanding off-the-shelf performance and using it as a baseline is an important step toward understanding degradation of performance over time, which is the focus of a much larger study to understand – mechanically and socially – how hand pumps perform, degrade, and ultimately meet human needs. In this paper, 110 off-the-shelf nitrile seals that were purchased in Uganda were tested and the following was characterized: (i) geometric variation, (ii) material variation, (iii) leak performance, and (iv) correlation between these. The seal leak performance was found to be very robust to variations in geometry and material at zero cycles. This important baseline supports our future work to understand how and to what degree seals become sensitive to geometric and material degradation during use.

Predicting and measuring heat transfer is critical to the design and operation of new boiler concepts. The individual contributions of gas and particle phases are dependent on gas and particle concentration, particle size, and gas and particle temperature which vary with location relative to the flame. A method for measuring the contributions of both gas and particle radiation capable of being applied in harsh high temperature and pressure environments has been demonstrated using emission from particles and water vapor using an optical fiber probe transmitting a signal to a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The method was demonstrated in four environments of varying gas and particle loading using natural gas and pulverized wood flames in a down-fired 130 kWth cylindrical reactor. The method generates a gas and particle temperature, gas concentrations (H2O and CO2), total gas and particle intensities, and gas and particle total effective emissivity from line-of-sight emission measurements. For the conditions measured, downstream of the luminous flame zone, water vapor and CO2 radiation were the dominant modes of heat transfer (effective emissivity 0.13-0.19) with particles making a minor contribution (effective emissivity 0.01-0.02). Within a lean natural gas flame, soot emission was low (effective emissivity 0.02) compared to gas (0.14) but within a luminous flame of burning wood particles (500 μm mean diameter) the particles (soot and burning wood) produced a higher effective emissivity (0.17) than the gas (0.12).

As example devices, we first examine 3D printed pumps, followed by two types of selectable ratio mixer pumps, a linear dilution mixer pump (LDMP) and a parallelized dilution mixer pump (PDMP), which occupy volumes of only 1.5 mm 3 and 2.6 mm 3, respectively. The LDMP generates a selectable dilution ratio from a linear set of possibilities, while the PDMP generates a denser set of possible dilutions with a maximum dilution ratio of 1/16.

To characterize LDMP and PDMP operation and performance, we present a new, low-cost video method to directly measure the relative concentration of an absorptive dye on a pixel-by-pixel basis for each video frame. Using this method, we find that 6 periods of the active mixer that forms the core of the LDMP and PDMP are sufficient to fully mix the fluid, and that the generated concentrations track the designed dilution ratios as expected.

In this study, we present, for the first time, combined X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ellipsometric (SE) studies of aluminum oxidation as a function of MgF2 over a range of layer thickness (0-6 nm). We also show for the first time, dynamic SE data which, with appropriate modeling, tracks the extent of oxide growth every few seconds over a period of several hours after the evaporated Al + MgF2 bilayer is removed from the deposition chamber, exposing it to the air. For each SE data set, because the optical constants of ultrathin metals films depend strongly on deposition conditions and their thickness, the optical constants for Al, as well as the Al and Al2O3 thicknesses, were fit. SE trends were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. There is a chemical shift in the Al 2s electron emission peak toward higher binding energy as the metal oxidizes to Al+3. The extent of oxide growth can be modeled from the relative area of each peak once they are corrected for the attenuation through MgF2 layer. This generates an empirical formula: oxide thickness= k∗log(t) +b, for the time-dependent aluminum-oxide thickness on aluminum surfaces protected by MgF2 as a function of MgF2 layer thickness. Here, k is a factor which depends only on MgF2 thickness, and decreases with increasing MgF2 thickness.

Participants used an optimization method of their choosing to find an optimal wind farm layout. Case study 2 looked at trade-offs in performance resulting from variation in both physics model and optimization strategy.

The thermal conductivity of these materials determines their ability to transfer heat from the reactor core to the surrounding coolant. Additionally, these actinide compounds are of interest in condensed matter physics because of the 5f orbitals and unique electron interaction, coupling, and scattering events that can occur. Because of the radioactivity of thorium and uranium, thin film measurements of actinide materials are used to limit the amount of operator exposure, but standard thermal characterization methods are not well suited for thin films. This paper presents the process of depositing thin film UOx and ThOx samples of nm-μm thicknesses and the results of thermal property measurements. Thin films were deposited on silicon and glass substrates via dc-magnetron sputtering using an argon/oxygen mixture as the working gas. The thermal properties of the films were measured by the Thermal Conductivity Microscope (TCM). This uses one laser to generate thermal waves and a second laser to measure the magnitude and phases of the thermal waves to obtain the conductivity of materials. The results of the research show that the UOx film properties are lower than bulk values and that the role of the substrate has a considerable effect on determining the measured properties.

In the past decade, due to its biocompatible nature, the medical field has expressed significant interest in magnesium for biodegradable implant applications. However, utilization of magnesium-based alloys in surgical implant applications is strictly limited by magnesium’s high vulnerability to corrosion causing premature disintegration inside the human body. Hydrophobic (non-wetting) behavior of metal surfaces has been proven to be beneficial for corrosion protection in academic literature. One way of achieving hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces on metal surfaces without using non-biocompatible coatings is creating uniform microstructures that would alter the wetting characteristics of the surface. This work focuses on creating uniform pillar shaped micro-patterns on smooth pure magnesium surfaces by utilizing a picosecond laser (λ = 355 nm). The study reports the effects of average laser power, partial laser beam overlap and number of laser scans on the height, steepness, roughness of the resultant micro-pillars.

In this paper, the results obtained from a proposed test method to evaluate the potential of efflorescence of ceramic blocks are compared to that obtained using the method described in ASTM C67. The proposed method was developed because until 2017 there was no Brazilian Standard to evaluate the efflorescence potential for brick and structural clay tile. The method uses 2Â ×Â 2Â ×Â 20-cm specimens immersed in 5-cm of distilled water for 5 days in recipients covered with a rubber membrane. The method uses smaller samples than the standard method and has a 5-day instead of 7-day duration. Ceramic blocks from ten manufacturers from different Brazilian regions were used in this study. Results from the standard test method indicated that blocks from three manufacturers were susceptible to efflorescence while the results from the proposed method indicated that the blocks were not susceptible to efflorescence. The discrepancy in results may have been caused by the very small size of the specimens and the large amount of water in the containers used in the proposed method. The amount of soluble salts in the small specimens may not have been enough to detect their presence and the soluble salts in the submerged part of a specimen may have simply dissolved by the water. © 2019, RILEM.",Book Chapter,

It pressurizes the fluid to delay the onset of cavitation, which can adversely affect performance in a centrifugal pump. In this paper, the performance of a water pump inducer has been explored with and without the implementation of a stability control device (SCD). This device is an inlet cover bleed system that removes high-energy fluid near the blade leading edge and reinjects it back upstream. The research was conducted by running multiphase, time-accurate computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations at the design flow coefficient and at low, off-design flow coefficients. The suction performance and stability for the same inducer with and without the implementation of the SCD has been explored. An improvement in stability and suction performance was observed when the SCD was implemented. Without the SCD, the inducer developed backflow at the blade tip, which led to rotating cavitation and larger rotordynamic forces. With the SCD, no significant cavitation instabilities developed, and the rotordynamic forces remained small. The lack of cavitation instabilities also allowed the inducer to operate at lower inlet pressures, increasing the suction performance of the inducer. Copyright © 2018 by ASME.",Article,

The problem requires estimating the relative pose between the vehicles. We assume that onboard inertial measurement units can provide roll and pitch estimates of the aircraft attitude. We examine the observability of other relative states needed to do the handoff problem. In particular, we consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the relative position between the aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a radar or a lidar sensor. We assume that the two aircrafts do not exchange their airspeed and turn rate information. Under mild assumptions, we show that the relative heading between the two aircrafts is observable. In the second scenario, we assume that only the bearing angle between the two aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a vision sensor. We prove state observability for maneuvers that are relevant to target tracking and handoff. We also present an estimation algorithm that uses a bank of extended Kalman filters to estimate the relative states.

In the considered configuration, a jet flame issues from a central nozzle into a vitiated coflow of hot combustion products from an array of lean H2/air flames. Centreline profiles for mixture fraction, temperature and mass fraction of O2 and OH obtained from ODT simulations with a planar and cylindrical formulation are shown and compared to measurements from Cabra et al. (2005). Additionally, two-dimensional renderings of the jet flame and scatter plots of temperature versus mixture fraction and OH mass fraction versus mixture fraction are provided. Although the application of ODT for reactive flows in jet configurations is not novel, the chosen lifted jet flame in a vitiated coflow represents a challenge for the model. The accurate representation of the subtle interactions of the hot coflow products with the cold unburnt jet flow are crucial for the reaction and autoignition of the jet (Cabra et al., 2005). Considering the reduced order of the model and the taken assumptions, the achieved results reasonably match with the measurement data. © 2019 International Symposium on Turbulence and Shear Flow Phenomena, TSFP.

Complexity is the New Normality, Proceedings",,,,"Promoting ethical conduct and social responsibility among undergraduate engineering graduates has been an ongoing challenge for many universities around the world. Among many factors shaping such commitments, the ethical climate within engineering degree programs specifically and universities more generally seems especially pertinent. Yet there remains a lack of research on, and understanding about, engineering students' perceptions of ethical climate, including how this changes over time and impacts their professional formation and values. This paper draws on an NSF-funded, mixed-methods, longitudinal research project conducted across four U.S. universities. The larger project aims to investigate perceptions and attitudes around ethics, social responsibility, and related concepts among engineering students. In this paper, we more specifically explore various facets of ethical climate across the three schools through a mixed-method explanatory study. We focus on quantitative survey measures (n=257) and qualitative interview data (n=33) collected from engineering students during their first and final years of college. We more specifically shed light on three main research objectives. First, we investigate how engineering students perceive ethical climate across the four universities. Second, we explore how students' perceptions of ethical climate change over time. Third, we look at how specific experiences may contribute to students' ethical climate perceptions, including changes over time. This study will appeal to engineering educators, policymakers and researchers who are interested in research on ethics, social responsibility, and related topics. By providing foundational insights about students' perceptions of ethical climate, we hope to inform strategies to improve the ethical climate at universities and ethical commitments of engineers. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

To this end, we conducted a three-phase redesign of the warning notifications surrounding the authentication ceremony in Signal. Our results show how improved comprehension can be achieved while still promoting favorable privacy outcomes among users. Our experience reaffirms existing arguments that users should be empowered to make personal trade-offs between perceived risk and response cost.

To evaluate the passive force-deflection curves for these materials, large-scale lab tests were performed with LCC and CLSM backfills in addition to a granular backfill for comparison. The response of the LCC was similar to that of the granular backfill with somewhat higher peak force developing at about 2.5% of the wall height. Although the stiffness was about twice as high as the granular backfill, the post-peak reduction was less than that for the granular fill. In contrast, the CLSM had a stiffness about 10 times higher than the granular fill and reached the peak value at a deflection equal to 1% of the wall height. The CLSM experienced a rapid decease in strength of about 60% after the peak strength was reached.

There is strong support for notification and consent when a system is intercepting their encrypted traffic, although this support varies depending on the situation. A significant concern about malicious uses of TLS inspection is identity theft, and many would react negatively and some would change their behavior if they discovered inspection occurring without their knowledge.

Within this context, users have a four-stage process for determining which security measures to adopt: learning, evaluation of risks, estimation of impact, and weighing trade-offs to various coping strategies. Our results also revealed that a majority of participants understand the basic principles of symmetric encryption.

These interviews were then transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes that may have been well understood or misunderstood by students. We found that a significant number of students had not understood concepts such as a design being more than a prototype, that sponsors have expectations for the tradeoffs between product cost and performance, or that they need to be thinking about how their designs might be deployed. It was also interesting to note that most students also reported feeling confident in their understanding despite their apparent lack thereof, indicating that these could represent major blind spots for students.

The SLW model is a so-called global engineering model for prediction of radiation transfer in gaseous media. The model bases the gas radiative properties on local thermodynamic properties (temperature, species concentration, etc.), and has been developed for use with any arbitrary solver of the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). This review first presents the fundamental groundwork for the SLW model, followed by the detailed theoretical development of the model with associated publication references. The model was first formulated for isothermal, homogeneous single-component gases. As part of this formulation a new gas property distribution function, the Absorption Line Blackbody Distribution Function (ALBDF) was proposed, and the ALBDF has been generated from detailed spectroscopic databases for H2O, CO2, and CO over a range of gas temperature, mole fraction (where appropriate), and total pressure. The SLW model was then extended to treat non-isothermal, non-homogeneous gases, mixtures of gas species, and model application in scenarios featuring non-gray particulates and/or boundaries. In all of its development the SLW model has been rigorously tested against benchmark line-by-line spectral integration solutions of the RTE using the same spectroscopic database as used in the generation of the ALBDF. Work continues on the refinement of the SLW model, enhancing its accuracy in prediction of radiative transfer. Finally, this review will summarize work-to-date utilizing the SLW model in coupled heat transfer scenarios—comprehensive combustion simulations, combined natural convection and radiation, etc. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Article,

In this paper, a method for defining a product's sustainability space (defined by economic, environmental, and social sustainability objectives) is outlined and used to explore the tradeoffs within the space, thus offering both the design team and the decision makers a means of better understanding the sustainability tradeoffs. This paper concludes that sustainable product development can indeed benefit from tradeoff characterization using multiobjective optimization techniques - even when using only basic models of sustainability. Interestingly, the unique characteristics of the three essential sustainable development areas lead to an alternative view of some traditional multiobjective optimization concepts, such as weak-Pareto optimality.

Because these devices can include complicated topography, many existing methods for depositing antireflective layers are difficult, impractical, or unusable. Aim: To create a light-blocking antireflective layer that works well with complicated MEMS and sensor devices, a layer should be made that is cheap, simple, and can be deposited and patterned with high resolution at low temperatures. Approach: Light blocking is achieved using an aluminum layer. Suppressing reflection is achieved by mixing aluminum oxide nanoparticles in photoresist to create a layer that partially absorbs and partially scatters light. Results: The combination of a layer of metal and a layer of nanoparticles and photoresist completely blocks transmission of light and significantly reduces reflections across the visible spectrum, particularly for shorter wavelengths.

Both pseudo-probabilistic and probabilistic (i.e., performance-based) methods are assessed and compared. Results of the comparative study suggest that pseudo-probabilistic methods can significantly overestimate liquefaction hazards in areas of low seismicity. Performance-based probabilistic methods are shown to predict between 5.2 cm and 16.5 cm (approximately 36–47%) less post-liquefaction free-field settlement on average than pseudo-probabilistic methods in areas of low seismicity at a return period of 2475 years, and to predict 9 cm to 19.7cm (approximately 96%) less post-liquefaction free-field settlement on average than pseudo-probabilistic methods at a return period of 475 years. Soil site classification is shown to have substantial impact on the estimated liquefaction hazards in areas of low seismicity due to soil amplification, potentially increasing design accelerations by up to 56%. Consequences of inconsistencies regarding design ground motions in current seismic design provisions are also discussed.

Several methods exist for stowing, deploying, and stiffening large space arrays. Often these functions are performed by separate systems. This paper presents a novel array system that integrates these functions into one system, without the need for external deployment or stiffening structures. The integration comes from the combination of the kinematics of origami-based folding approaches, stored strain energy of compliant hinges, and tension cables. Additionally, due to the origami-based folding approach used, tunable deployed shapes and retraction are possible using reeled cables. The result is a new class of arrays that are self-deployable, self-stiffening, and retractable (SDSR), which are described in this work.

This large spatial aperture allows for detailed investigation into the spatial variation in broadband shock-associated noise and fine- and large-scale turbulent mixing noise. The spectral models used in the decomposition capture the main features of the measured spectra with three exceptions: 1) that the F-35B engine noise contains multiple spectral peaks in the maximum radiation region, 2) that the nonlinear propagation increases the high-frequency spectral levels, and 3) that the low-frequency levels in the maximum radiation region are less than those predicted by the large-scale similarity spectrum. The F-35B broadband shock-associated noise has the same characteristic shape and variation in peak frequency as overexpanded, laboratory-scale jets. However, the peak level and width exhibit different trends than laboratory-scale broadband shock-associated noise and those recently reported for the F/A-18E aircraft. The strengths and limitations of current models to represent the spatial variation in the spectral content of F-35B noise can guide research efforts to more fully understand the sound radiation.

The Sobrado Vallim was built as the house of the local coffee Baron. Since being unoccupied by the family, the building has served as a school and as the City Hall; more recently the building has housed a local community association. The first story is formed by rammed earth walls supporting a wood floor. The walls on the second floor are built with adobe blocks, and several wood columns embedded into the walls support the wood roof trusses. The building has been unoccupied for several years and a temporary shoring system has been designed and installed to prevent possible collapse. The analyses included measuring and defining the building structural elements to determine their capacity. The rammed earth walls compression strength was determined using flatjacks. Samples of the adobe blocks were obtained so that their physical and mechanical properties could be determined through laboratory testing. Thermography was used to assess the wood elements condition. The proposed structural solution was to maintain the shell of the building and construct a steel frame structure within the existing elements. The steel frame would reduce the span and partially support the roof trusses at their mid-length. The ends of the wood trusses would still bear on the existing second floor walls. The proposed solution reduced significantly the loads on the existing elements, allowing the form the building to be maintained. © 2019, RILEM.",Book Chapter,

Based on the angle of propagation, derivative skewness, and overall sound pressure level, the microphone pairs along the array can be sorted into six groups.

Recent modifications to LES methods allow for simulations of jets operating at a high temperature ratio, in a similar regime as military aircraft operating at afterburner. This work applies coherence analyses that have been previously used to study the jet noise field produced by military aircraft to the LES of a highly-heated, laboratory-scale jet. The coherence of the complex pressures along a near-field line approximately parallel to the shear layer shows evidence of four distinct field regions. The coherence between this line and complex pressures along the simulated jet lipline provide source regions in the jet plume corresponding to each field region. Differences in how information is transferred from the flow to the field suggests that the source regions represent different noise production mechanisms.

Although users may fail to heed a security warning for a variety of reasons, a major contributor is habituation, which is decreased response to repeated stimulation. However, the scope of this problem may actually be much broader than previously thought because of the neurobiological phenomenon of generalization. Whereas habituation describes a diminished response with repetitions of the same stimulus, generalization occurs when habituation to one stimulus carries over to other novel stimuli that are similar in appearance. Generalization has important implications for the domains of usable security and human-computer interaction. Because a basic principle of user interface design is visual consistency, generalization suggests that through exposure to frequent non-security-related notifications (e.g., dialogs, alerts, confirmations, etc.) that share a similar look and feel, users may become deeply habituated to critical security warnings that they have never seen before. Further, with the increasing number of notifications in our lives across a range of mobile, Internet of Things, and computing devices, the accumulated effect of generalization may be substantial. However, this problem has not been empirically examined before. This paper contributes by measuring the impacts of generalization in terms of (1) diminished attention via mouse cursor tracking and (2) users' ability to behaviorally adhere to security warnings. Through an online experiment, we find that: • Habituation to a frequent non-security-related notification does carry over to a one-time security warning. • Generalization of habituation is manifest both in (1) decreased attention to warnings and (2) lower warning adherence behavior. • The carry-over effect, most importantly, is due to generalization, and not fatigue. • The degree that generalization occurs depends on the similarity in look and feel between a notification and warning. These findings open new avenues of research and provide guidance to software developers for creating warnings that are more resistant to the effects of generalization of habituation, thereby improving users' security warning adherence. © is held by the author/owner.",Conference Paper,

The approach is based on rank aggregation, which meaningfully utilizes the correlation among the relevance ranks of predictor variables given by three state-of-the-art feature selectors: Relief-F, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), and maximum likelihood feature selection (MLFS). By applying the SVM combined with MVFS on a self-created dataset containing maximal and submaximal exercise data from 185 college students, several new hybrid VO2max prediction models have been created. To compare the performance of the proposed ensemble approach on prediction of VO2max, SVM-based models with individual combinations of Relief-F, mRMR, and MLFS as well as with other alternative ensemble feature selectors from the literature have also been developed. The results reveal that MVFS outperforms other individual and ensemble feature selectors and yields up to 8.76% increment and 11.15% decrement rates in multiple correlation coefficients (Rs) and root mean square errors (RMSEs), respectively. Furthermore, in addition to reconfirming the relevance of sex, age, and maximal heart rate in predicting VO2max, which were previously reported in the literature, it is revealed that submaximal heart rates and exercise times at 1.5-mile distance are two further discriminative predictors of VO2max. The results have also been compared to those obtained by a general regression neural network and single decision tree combined with MVFS, and it is shown that the SVM exhibits much better performance than other methods for prediction of VO2max. © TÜBİTAK",Article,"['Ensemble feature selection', ' Maximal oxygen uptake', ' Prediction', ' Rank aggregation', ' Support vector machineDecision trees', ' Feature extraction', ' Forecasting', ' Heart', ' Maximum likelihood', ' Mean square error', ' Neural networks', ' Students', ' Ensemble feature selections', ' General regression neural network', ' Maximal oxygen uptake', ' Minimum redundancy-maximum relevances', ' Multiple correlation coefficients', ' Predictor variables', ' Rank aggregation', ' Root mean square errors', ' Support vector machines']"

Design: Ten individuals at high risk of developing hip osteoarthritis (SibKids) underwent contemporaneous T2 mapping and dGEMRIC in the hip (10 hips). Twelve healthy volunteers underwent T2 mapping of both hips (24 hips) at time points 25, 35, 45, and 55 minutes post offloading. Acetabular and femoral cartilage was manually segmented into regions of interest. The relationship between T2 and dGEMRIC values from anatomically corresponding regions of interests was quantified using Pearson’s correlation. The reproducibility of image analysis for T2 and dGEMRIC, and reproducibility of image acquisition for T2, was quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), root mean square coefficient of variance (RMSCoV), smallest detectable difference (SDD), and Bland-Altman plots. The paired t test was used to determine if difference existed in T2 values at different unloading times. Results: T2 values correlated most strongly with dGEMRIC values in diseased cartilage (r = −0.61, P = <0.001). T2 image analysis (segmentation) reproducibility was ICC = 0.96 to 0.98, RMSCoV = 3.5% to 5.2%, and SDD = 2.2 to 3.5 ms. T2 values at 25 minutes unloading were not significantly different to longer unloading times (P = 0.132). SDD for T2 image acquisition reproducibility was 7.1 to 7.4 ms. Conclusions: T2 values in the hip correlate well with dGEMRIC in areas of cartilage damage. T2 shows high reproducibility and values do not change beyond 25 minutes of joint unloading. © The Author(s) 2019.",Article,

Developable surfaces are shapes that a flat sheet can take without tearing or stretching, and they represent a wide range of manufactured surfaces. This work introduces “developable mechanisms” as devices that emerge from or conform to developable surfaces. They are made possible by aligning hinge axes with developable surface ruling lines to enable mobility. Because rigid-link motion depends on the relative orientation of hinge axes and not link geometry, links can take the shape of the corresponding developable surface. Mechanisms are classified by their associated surface type, and these relationships are defined and demonstrated by example. Developable mechanisms show promise for meeting unfilled needs using systems not previously envisioned. © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved.",Article,

In particular, electronics can be embedded directly into structural components in nearly arbitrary 3D space.

This work demonstrates a test method to quantitatively measure the adhesion failure of printed inks deposited on a substrate without changing the ink printing conditions. The proposed method is an adaption of single lap shear testing in which the lap joint is created by bonding the second substrate to the ink after curing. It was found that the interfacial shear strengths are independent of the adhesives used to attach cured conductive ink to the second substrate. In addition, chemical surface treatments of flame and plasma and mechanical sand-blasting increase the interfacial shear strengths by ~25% and 80%, respectively, while altering the adhesive failure mode to cohesive failure for most cases.

Two mortars were tested, with volume proportions of cement: Lime: Sand of 1:0.5:4 and 1:1:6. From these two specimen heights, 50 and 140mm, with diameter of 45mm, resulting in diameter/height ratios of 1.0 and 0.3, were manufactured. The experimental results indicated that the confinement and strength of the mortar influence its stress-strain behaviour, the larger the confinement, the more, nonlinear the behaviour. In addition, the results indicated that the Poisson’s ratio and tangent modulus of elasticity vary with increasing applied load. Two numerical models were tested using the same finite element mesh, boundary conditions and load. The first model was based on the Total Strain Smeared Crack Model and the second model accounted for the observations from the experimental phase with a nonlinear “elastic phased” analysis, which updates the modulus of elasticity and the Poisson’s ratio at each new phase. The tangent modulus of elasticity was calculated directly from the experimental results while the Poisson’s ratio was approximated using the model proposed by OTTOSEN [16]. The numerical model based on the total strain smeared crack was not able to reproduce the behaviour of the compressed mortar near failure while the phased model presented satisfactory results, even close to failure, when cracking is significant. © 2019, International Masonry Society.

On a wettable horizontal surface, where a sufficient downstream liquid depth can be sustained after axisymmetric impingement, the jet forms a thin film on the substrate up to a radial distance where the film height suddenly increases, forming a hydraulic jump. On a superhydrophobic surface, where a downstream liquid depth is not naturally sustained, the thin film expands and breaks up into droplets, which are subsequently ejected in a random fashion outward, as carried by their radial momentum. In the present work, a facile, scalable, wettability-patterning approach is presented for delaying or even eliminating droplet breakup in the case of jet impingement on horizontal superhydrophobic surfaces. Analytical expressions for predicting the hydraulic jump and droplet breakup locations are developed to designate the proper wettability patterns that facilitate alteration and control of the postimpingement liquid behavior.

We here present observations and analyses of the M7.1 September 19, 2017, event that -while triggered by an intraplate rupture at approximately half the epicentral distance of the 1985 event relative to Mexico City -caused severe structural damage to a few tens of buildings located in a relatively narrow zone between the hill and lake zones of the basin, known as the transition zone.

The vision for this guiding coalition is to 1) set up a repository for source code, data, benchmarks, and documentation, 2) encourage good coding practices, 3) review and comment on the models and data submitted, 4) test, use and improve the code, 5) propose and collect anonymized real data, 6) attract talent and support to the effort, and 7) mentor those getting started. Those interested to add their time and talent to the cause may publish their results through peer-reviewed literature. Several online meetings are planned to create this coalition, establish a charter, and layout the guiding principles. Multiple support avenues are proposed to sustain the effort such as: annual user group meetings, create a SPE Technical Section, and initiating a Joint Industry Program (JIP). The Open Porous Media Initiative is just one example of how this could be organized and maintained. As a starting point, this paper reviews existing published drilling models and highlights the similarities and differences for commonly used drillstring hydraulics, dynamics, directional, and bit-rock interaction models. The key requirements for re-usability of the models and code are: 1) The model itself must be available as open source, well documented with the objective and expected outcomes, include commented code, and shared in a publicly available repository which can be updated, 2) A user's guide must include how to run the core software, how to extend software capabilities, i.e., plug in new features or elements, 3) Include a ""theory"" manual to explain the fundamental principles, the base equations, any assumptions, and the known limitations, 4) Data examples and formatting requirements to cover a diversity of drilling operations, and 5) Test cases to benchmark the performance and output of different proposed models. In May 2018 at ""The 4th International Colloquium on Non-linear dynamics and control of deep drilling systems,"" the keynote question was, ""Is it time to start using open source models?"" The answer is ""yes"". Modeling the drilling process is done to help drill a round, ledge free hole, without patterns, with minimum vibration, minimum unplanned dog legs, that reaches all geological targets, in one run per section, and in the least time possible. An open source repository for drilling will speed up the rate of learning and automation efforts to achieve this goal throughout the entire well execution workflow, including planning, BHA design, real-time operations, and post well analysis.

This DRM architecture involves five landing sites (Malapert massif, South Pole/Shackleton crater, Schrödinger basin, Antoniadi crater, and the South Pole-Aitken basin center), to be visited in sequential years by crew, beginning in 2028. Two Lunar Electric Rovers (LER) are proposed to be tele-robotically operated between sites to rendez-vous with crew at the time of the next landing. With engineering parameters in mind we explore the feasibility of tele-robotic operation of these LERs between lunar landing sites, and identify potential high interest sampling locations en-route. Additionally, in-depth sample collection and return traverses are identified for each individual landing site across key geologic terrains that also detail crew Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA).

This is a time-consuming approach and there remains uncertainty in the crash data integrity. The surrogate safety assessment model (SSAM) was developed for resolving these issues. With SSAM, a conflict analysis is performed in a simulated environment. A planned improvement alternative is modeled and no physical installation of the alternative is needed. This study evaluated if SSAM can be used to assess the safety of a highway segment in terms of the number and type of conflicts and to compare the safety effects of multiple access management alternatives. An evaluation of the effect of converting a two-way left-turn lane (TWLTL) into a raised median on a section of an urban street was performed using SSAM working on VISSIM simulation’s trajectory files. The analysis showed that a raised median would be much safer than a TWLTL median for the same level of traffic volume, with approximately 32 to 50 percent reduction in the number of crossing conflicts. The analysis showed that about 34,000 to 38,000 veh/day would be the demand level where the median conversion is recommended for the four-lane study section. The study concluded that the combination of a simulation software program with SSAM could be a viable surrogate analysis approach for evaluating and comparing the safety effects of multiple access management alternatives. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018.",Article,

The surface microstructures were geometrically defined by cavity fraction (the ratio of projected cavity area to surface area), pitch (the center to center distance between microfeatures), and feature height. Surface heat flux and surface superheat, the difference between the heated surface and the pool saturation temperature, were measured for each surface. Ten different micropatterned surfaces with post or rib geometries were considered with cavity fraction varying from 0.5 to 0.98, pitch varying from 8 to 40 μm, and microfeature height at 4 μm or 15 μm. The surface heat flux was measured across a range of surface superheats spanning 2–38 K. It is demonstrated for the first time that the transition from nucleate boiling to film boiling on rib patterned surfaces depends strongly on the cavity fraction. Increasing the microstructure height from 4 μm to 15 μm modestly increases the transition temperature. Nucleate boiling is more suppressed on post patterned surfaces than on rib patterned surfaces. Further, the rib structured surfaces exhibit a sudden transition from nucleate to film boiling while the post structured surfaces exhibit a gradual transition, with the vapor film growing slowly across the surface. Once stable film boiling is reached, the surface microstructure negligibly influences the heat flux for all surfaces. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"['Film boiling', ' Microstructure', ' Pool boiling', ' Post patterned', ' Rib patterned', ' Superhydrophobic surfaceEvaporation', ' Geometry', ' Heat transfer', ' Hydrophobicity', ' Microstructure', ' Nucleate boiling', ' Surface properties', ' Film boiling', ' Pool boiling', ' Post patterned', ' Rib patterned', ' Super-hydrophobic surfaces', ' Heat flux']"

This submerged jump can occur for a range of upstream and downstream conditions. A multiple partial width deflector design for the downstream side of the dam was tested in the laboratory to determine effectiveness in completely or partially eliminating the submerged hydraulic jump. The results demonstrate that a dramatic reduction in upstream-directed surface velocities over a wide range of headwater and tailwater conditions is possible.

The results showed the FA is better as a support of OC than the most commonly used Al2O3 in anti-carbon deposition and thus beneficial to the importance of the stability of FA supported OCs.

The characterization of the fresh and spent OCs revealed that the FA support itself could provide 1.0–2.9 wt% active oxygen for fuel combustion, which is enabled by the iron oxide in FA. In addition, the distribution of Cu on the FA support became more uniform on spent OC than on the fresh one. Also, the partially irreversible CuO decomposition into Cu2O during cyclic tests was the main reason for the deactivation of OC.

User testing with four different models (i.e. chair, maze, truck, sculpture) and survey responses suggest respectively that design in virtual reality promoted greater creativity in modeling, allowed for a greater feature creation rate, and that a slight majority of test participants preferred modeling in VR compared to traditional CAD applications. © 2018, © 2018 CAD Solutions, LLC.",Article,"['3D printing. rapid prototyping', ' modeling', ' proof of concept', ' user testing', ' Virtual realityAutomobile testing', ' Integration testing', ' Models', ' Surveys', ' Three dimensional computer graphics', ' Virtual reality', ' 3-D printing', ' CAD applications', ' Development stages', ' Proof of concept', ' Rectangular prisms', ' Three-dimensional model', ' User testing', ' Virtual reality modeling', ' Computer aided design']"

The objective of this work is to investigate the Integrated Spectral Band Ratio (ISBR) method for measuring the temperature of combustion product gases surrounded by radiating walls or within a mixture of gas and particles. Five conditions in a multi-fuel reactor were investigated using an optical probe. A Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer provided detailed spectral measurements of hot gas and particle emissions at wavelengths of 1.69–2.15 μm, focusing on a spectral region where H2O is the dominant participating gas. These measurements were used to infer the gas temperature of the flows. It was found that the measurement path length needed to be at least 0.25 m in order to obtain a signal large enough to infer temperature accurately. For four of the five operating conditions tested, optically measured gas temperatures were found to be in good agreement with the average temperature along the measured path as taken with a suction pyrometer (aspirated thermocouple). For these four operating conditions the particle media were optically thin. Temperatures for the in-flame fine wood particle condition did not exhibit as good of agreement due to high particle loading causing optically thick zones along the line of sight. Modeling experiments showed that when particles and gasses are optically thin, the optical gas temperature measured with this technique will be near the arithmetic mean of the line of sight temperature. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Article,

Circular micropillars 4 μm in height with varying center-to-center distances (pitch) of 8 μm, 12 μm and 16 μm, are used to create the superhydrophobic surfaces. The range of surface temperatures explored is 110°C&lt;Ts&lt;337°C. An image processing algorithm was developed to quantify the temporal behavior of thermally induced atomization captured via high-speed photography. Results show thermally induced atomization is initially absent (&lt;1 ms following impact) on all surfaces. The amount of ejected droplets later during droplet spreading is determined as a function of surface structuring and temperature. Atomization ceases when the surface has cooled sufficiently (2.5–4 ms depending on the surface). The maximum amount of atomization for a given scenario is highly dependent on surface temperature and surface microstructure characteristics. At low surface temperatures, atomization increases with increasing surface temperature; however at high surface temperatures atomization decreases with increasing surface temperature. This rise and fall behavior is tantamount to the classical relationship between heat flux and surface temperature for pool boiling. Both droplet impingement and pool boiling depend on vapor bubble formation dynamics and the stability of the so-called Leidenfrost vapor film, which is impacted by surface wettability. Results also show that small surface pitch causes a high atomization intensity, indicating that not all superhydrophobic surfaces sustain Leidenfrost-like behavior at all excess temperatures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,

Moment frame configurations offer the most architectural flexibility, but are somewhat limited by a lack of guidance in the AISC seismic provisions regarding the use of non-orthogonal (skewed) beam-column connections. A recent study investigating laterally skewed moment frame connections indicates adequate seismic performance; however, it was observed that skewed connections increase the potential for column twist and column flange yielding. It is unclear how larger column axial loads present in medium-to-high-rise structures will affect the performance of skewed special moment frame connections. This study investigates the effects of column axial loads on skewed special moment frame connections containing reduced beam sections (RBSs). Detailed finite element analyses are used for all investigations, and several beam-column connection configurations are considered, representing: 3 beam-column geometries (shallow, medium and deep columns); 4 levels of skew at the beam-to-column connection; and 4 levels of applied column axial load. Results indicate that for axial loads less than 50% of the column axial capacity, there is little effect on connection rotation capacity. Beam-skew angle is the main contributor to resulting column twist. With the exception of the deep column geometries that experienced local flange buckling at 50% ΦPn axial load, increased column axial loads have little effect on resulting column flange yielding in skewed RBS moment connections. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,

Modeling and optimization of various carbon capture technologies such as pre-combustion, oxy-fuel, and post-combustion, when integrated with coal-fired power plants, have been researched extensively in literature. Research on the integration of power generation with capture technologies regarding comparisons between the different schemes in response to dynamic inputs is lacking. This work provides a comparison between a low temperature carbon capture and a chemical absorption process in response to a dynamic electricity demand and price profile and in the presence of an intermittent wind power supply. The objective in this work is to meet the overall electricity demand of residential users and the carbon capture process while the total operating cost associated with the integrated system of power generation and carbon capture is minimized. This comparison includes scenarios with and without energy storage associated with each capture technology. It is observed that in both integrated systems, with and without energy storage, the overall electricity demanded by the capture process and residential users is supplied by a combination of coal and wind power. For the case without energy storage, the total operating cost and energy demand of the low temperature carbon capture, based on a similar amount of captured carbon dioxide, are 4.3% and 20.5% less than that of chemical absorption, respectively.

The observed flexural strengths were 1.4–2.7 times greater than those calculated neglecting the block-out concrete, because the block-out concrete effectively thickened and expanded the column base plate.

The US Army Engineer Research and Development Center Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory is developing the capability for military planners to rapidly optimize vessel routes in water environments by extending capabilities of the Rapid Operational Access and Maneuver Support (ROAMS) modeling platform. The ROAMS platform allows users to rapidly generate models of a water environment in limited-information conditions, utilizing the Adaptive Hydraulics and STeady-state spectral WAVE computational engines for the base two-dimensional hydrodynamics and waves, respectively. Routing capabilities are built on path search and penalty-barrier optimization to automatically produce routes that account for temporally changing environmental variables and vessel maneuverability. This work outlines the components of the ROAMS routing package and presents a case study using ROAMS in a northeastern American metropolitan area. Benefits and limitations of the ROAMS routing platform are discussed and future improvements are suggested. © The Author(s) 2018.",Article,"['logistics', ' military logistics', ' Operation planning', ' route modeling', ' vessel route planningFighter aircraft', ' Hydraulics', ' Parameter estimation', ' Specifications', ' Changing constraints', ' Coastal and hydraulics laboratories', ' Coastal environments', ' Environmental variables', ' Military logistics', ' Operation planning', ' Route planning', ' Two-dimensional hydrodynamics', ' Logistics']"

Protection from photocorrosion is demonstrated by comparing the time evolution of photoluminescence from PbS-FTN with that of non-ferritin PbS quantum dots.

Second, the pseudo-static modeling procedure for the dynamic analysis is implemented in a statics-similar way based on D'alembert's principle. Then, all the kinematic, static and dynamic performances of compliant mechanisms can be analyzed based on the pseudo-static model. The superiority of the proposed method is that when it is used for the dynamic modeling of compliant mechanisms, the traditional dynamic modeling procedures, such as calculation of the elastic and kinetic energies as well as using Lagrange's equation, are avoided and the dynamic modeling is converted to a staticssimilar problem.

Analysis of complicated thermal systems is simplified through application of apparent radiative properties to cavity geometries. The apparent radiative properties of a specularly-reflecting, gray, isothermal V-groove have been derived analytically, but these results have not been validated experimentally or numerically. Additionally, the model for apparent absorptivity of an infinite V-groove subjected to partial illumination in the presence of collimated irradiation is not available. In this work, the following existing models for a specularly-reflecting V-groove are collected into a single source: (1) the apparent absorptivity of a diffusely irradiated V-groove, (2) the apparent emissivity of an isothermal V-groove and (3) the apparent absorptivity of a V-groove subject to collimated irradiation with full-illumination. Further, a new analytical model is developed to predict the apparent absorptivity of an infinite V-groove subject to collimated irradiation with partial-illumination. A custom, Monte Carlo ray tracing solver is used to predict the apparent radiative properties for all cases as a means of numerical verification by comparing the ray tracing data with the results from the new model in this work and the previously existing models. For diffuse irradiation, the analytical model and ray tracing data show excellent agreement with an average discrepancy of 4.4 × 10−4, verifying the diffuse-irradiation analytical model.

This approach is effective in rewarding vehicles to search out areas which haven't been visited in a long time, yet it lacks the ability to weight grid cells differently based on the probability that targets will be in that section. This paper proposes a method of using accumulated knowledge of the average density of targets within an area, along with a Gaussian process regression to assign rewards. Vehicles then choose paths that are more likely to find targets rather than seeking areas which have not been searched recently.

We derive error bounds for the fidelity of this class of observable functions, as well as identify two key learning parameters which can be used to tune performance. We illustrate our approach on two classical nonlinear system models: the Van Der Pol oscillator and the bistable toggle switch. © 2018 AACC.",Conference Paper,

Our work combines motion detection with optical flow and feature matching to allow stationary objects to be tracked. We use a feature prioritization algorithm to reduce computational complexity and spatial redundancy.

ODT has been applied to a wide range of complex multi-scale flows, such as turbulent combustion. Previous ODT comparisons to experimental data have focused mainly on planar flows. Applications to cylindrical flows, such as round jets, have been based on rough analogies, e.g., by exploiting the fortuitous consistency of the similarity scalings of temporally developing planar jets and spatially developing round jets. To obtain a more systematic treatment, a new formulation of the ODT model in cylindrical and spherical coordinates is presented here. The model is written in terms of a geometric factor so that planar, cylindrical, and spherical configurations are represented in the same way. Temporal and spatial versions of the model are presented. A Lagrangian finite-volume implementation is used with a dynamically adaptive mesh. The adaptive mesh facilitates the implementation of cylindrical and spherical versions of the triplet map, which is used to model turbulent advection (eddy events) in the one-dimensional flow coordinate. In cylindrical and spherical coordinates, geometric stretching of the three triplet map images occurs due to the radial dependence of volume, with the stretching being strongest near the centerline. Two triplet map variants, TMA and TMB, are presented. In TMA, the three map images have the same volume, but different radial segment lengths. In TMB, the three map images have the same radial segment lengths, but different segment volumes. Cylindrical results are presented for temporal pipe flow, a spatial nonreacting jet, and a spatial nonreacting jet flame. These results compare very well to direct numerical simulation for the pipe flow, and to experimental data for the jets. The nonreacting jet treatment overpredicts velocity fluctuations near the centerline, due to the geometric stretching of the triplet maps and its effect on the eddy event rate distribution. TMB performs better than TMA. A hybrid planar-TMB (PTMB) approach is also presented, which further improves the results. TMA, TMB, and PTMB are nearly identical in the pipe flow where the key dynamics occur near the wall away from the centerline. The jet flame illustrates effects of variable density and viscosity, including dilatational effects. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"['Cylindrical', ' ODT', ' One-dimensional turbulence', ' Turbulence modelingCombustion', ' Image segmentation', ' Mesh generation', ' Pipe flow', ' Spheres', ' Turbulence', ' Turbulence models', ' Computationally efficient', ' Cylindrical', ' One dimensional turbulence', ' One-dimensional turbulence model', ' One-dimensional turbulence modeling', ' Spherical configurations', ' Spherical coordinates', ' Velocity fluctuations', ' Fighter aircraft', ' advection', ' comparative study', ' cylinder', ' geometry', ' numerical model', ' one-dimensional modeling', ' pipe flow', ' turbulence']"

These techniques can be used to reduce the requirements on CSI prior to code construction, because the codes will either adapt to the operating parameters of the legitimate user's channel on the fly and/or target a maximum allowable probability of intercept (POI) at the eavesdropper.

This is accomplished by breaking the constellation down into nested quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) symbols and randomizing the assignment between message bits and modulated symbols using channel state information (CSI). If enough random bits can be generated from CSI it becomes possible to uniquely map an arbitrary message to any symbol in the large QAM constellation.

Understanding the fundamental physical phenomena associated with radiative transfer in these environments is thus critical to predicting the physical phenomena. This chapter seeks to present the fundamental physics of radiative transfer in high-temperature gases and review the viable methods for predicting the associated radiative transfer. The general physical statements of gas radiation are first formulated. It is shown that the principal properties of molecular gases needed for the radiative transfer equation are the gas spectral absorption cross section and the spectral absorption coefficient. Radiation constants and equations are explicitly written in terms of wavenumber for gas radiation. The fundamentals of the physical nature of gas radiation are presented to contextualize the spectral properties - what defines positions, strength, and shape of spectral lines at given temperature and pressure. The chapter provides the information needed to find and to read spectroscopic databases such as HITRAN and HITEMP and how to use the compiled data to assemble the gas absorption spectra for both the gas absorption cross section and the gas absorption coefficient. The principles of narrow band models and global models of gas radiation are formulated. The statistical narrow band model with Malkmus' distribution function of line strength for an array of Lorentz lines is presented, and its application for modeling of radiation transfer in nonuniform media is explained. The wide range of global models of gas radiation starting from gray model and weightedsum- of-gray-gases model and their development into more advanced models such as SLW, ADF, and FSK is described. While more detailed attention is given to the SLW model, its relation to the FSK and ADF models is outlined. Finally, the application of global models for prediction of radiative transfer in nonuniform gaseous medium is presented. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

The purpose of the tests was to evaluate the performance of several empirical and semiempirical formulae using a single calibration point relative to three uncalibrated equations. The seven equations were included because they either have a calibration procedure already developed, are used frequently in practice, are historically foundational in the field, or have recently been proposed. Results are expressed in the root mean square error of the logarithms (RMSEL) and the relative mean error (RME) and show that the Pagosa good and Barry equations best predict bedload sediment transport (RMSEL of 0.02 and 0.02, respectively).

Purpose/Hypothesis: The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of how students respond, via engagement, to their engineering design activities during class. This study hypothesizes that students would experience no self-reported mean changes in topic emotions from their preassessment scores for each engineering design topic and instructional format nor would electrodermal activities (EDA) associate to these topic emotions throughout the design activities. Design/Method: Eighty-eight freshmen engineering students completed online pretopic and posttopic emotions surveys for five engineering design activities. A subset of 14–18 participants, the focal point of this study, wore an EDA sensor while completing the surveys and participating in these sessions. Results: Preliminary findings suggest that EDA increased for individual and collaborative active learning activities compared to lectures. No significant changes in EDA were found between individual and collaborative active learning activities. Moderate negative correlations were found between EDA and negative topic emotions in the first engineering design activity but not across the rest. At the end of the semester, active learning activities showed higher effect sizes indicating a re-enforcement of students' engagement in the engineering design method activities.

A major shortcoming of most commercially available 3D printers is that their resolution is not sufficient to produce features that are truly microfluidic (&lt; 100 × 100 μm2). Here, we test a custom 3D printer for making ~30 μm scale positive and negative surface features, as well as positive and negative features within internal voids (i.e., microfluidic channels). We found that optical dosage control is essential for creating the smallest microfluidic features (~30 μm wide for ridges, ~20 μm wide for trenches), and that this resolution was achieved for a number of different exposure approaches. Additionally, we printed various microfluidic particle traps, showed capture of 25 μm diameter polymer beads, and iteratively improved the trap design. The rapid feedback allowed by 3D printing, as well as the ability to carefully control optical exposure conditions, should lead to new innovations in the types and sizes of devices that can be created for microfluidics. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,"['3D printing', ' Microfluidics', ' Particle traps', ' Stereolithography3D printers', ' Fluidic devices', ' Printing presses', ' Stereolithography', ' 3-D printing', ' Exposure conditions', ' Micro-fluidic devices', ' Microfluidic channel', ' Particle traps', ' Rapid feedback', ' Surface feature', ' Three-dimensional (3D) printing', ' Microfluidics']"

The specifics of this aspect of the study involved a grass-roots movement where construction education was introduced to elementary students (grades 4 - 6). The research model involved giving the students a construction interest inventory and career placement inventory pre-and post-participation in an after-school 3D modeling construction centric curriculum. The curriculum introduced students to the construction fields by giving the students weekly snapshots into construction careers, and also required the students to learn about floor and elevation plans. Students were then taught and expected to design a 3D computer model of a home using Minecraft and Sketchup. The students were provided 4 different models to choose from. The course used a competition based pedagogy where the best home designs were awarded prizes. The results show that student interest after this single intervention (1 semester in length) increased student interest in careers associated to construction. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.",Conference Paper,

A combination of visual art and innovative engineering offers an unusual opportunity to engage a wide spectrum of society. To evaluate the potential, faculty and students collaborated with the Brigham Young University Museum of Art to create a museum exhibition that connected the art of origami to engineering, math, science, and product design. A framework is introduced that includes the creation of a museum exhibition; and once the initial investment is made to create the central exhibition, the results are efficiently used to extend outreach efforts through first-generation products (coincident with the exhibition) and then through second-generation products (after the exhibition). The paper describes a detailed example of this framework and provides evidence to support the concept that displaying research artifacts in an art museum can expand research opportunities. Products from the exhibition that provided expanded outreach opportunities include the following: an exhibit catalog originally created for the gift shop that was expanded for publication with a national publisher; a tablet/smart phone app that includes origami instructions followed by related engineering activities, which has had broad use beyond the museum activity room; a video that was prepared for museum patrons but has since been made available to larger audiences; materials created for hands-on museum activities that were used for outreach activities after the exhibition; and leverage for industry visits that led to additional applications and research projects.

['57203310052'],Transitioning a manufacturing systems engineering course to student-centered learning,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",,1.0,,"This evidence-based paper describes the transition of a senior-level manufacturing engineering course from a traditional lecture-focused curriculum to a more engaging curriculum based on the research in student-centered learning. Many college courses have a familiar format: students listen to lectures, read textbooks, complete assignments, and demonstrate their learning through exams. Often, the instructor will structure the course for convenience, perhaps creating highly structured PowerPoint presentations and using standardized multiple choice exams to easily grade performance. Students, on the other hand, then structure their learning practices to match - trying to determine exactly how much to come to class, read, and memorize, with the end goal of regurgitating information on the exam and getting a satisfactory grade in the course. These practices are not conducive to long-term retention and application by the students, nor to accurate assessment or facilitation of learning by the instructor. But unless both the instructor and the students in a course understand and are amenable to alternative techniques, the format is unlikely to change. There has been extensive research on techniques aimed to increase student engagement in the classroom, such as ""flipping the classroom"" and identifying and overcoming the ""illusion of learning."" This paper describes the efforts of the author over three semesters to incorporate these tools into a senior-level course on manufacturing system design and lean manufacturing to help facilitate better learning and assess proficiency more effectively. Several techniques are used, including suggestions from the recent book Make It Stick by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel.

Concerns also persist about the moral and ethical commitments of engineers once they enter the workplace, as underscored by a number of recent ethics scandals involving engineers and technology. The education of ethically adept engineers therefore remains a pertinent issue for the engineering education community. Yet there remains relatively little research on how students' prior experiences shape their ethical perspectives. Specifically, there is a lack of understanding of the role of pre-college and early college experiences and other influences in shaping first-year engineering students' views on ethics. This paper reports select results from an NSF-funded project aiming to address some of these gaps in the literature. This longitudinal study was conducted across four universities and focused on the ethical development of undergraduate engineering students. Preliminary analysis of interviews from the first phase of this study identified a number of major themes in the data set, two of which are important to highlight here: 1) influences on students' ethical perspectives (e.g., academic curricular, extracurricular activities, family, etc.) and 2) learned outcomes, defined as insights, learning, or realizations related to ethics, morality, and values. Deeper investigation of the relationship between specific influences and students' insights related to ethics can provide a better understanding of first-year engineering students' baseline ethical development. The goal of this paper is to characterize what specific ethical lessons are gained through various types of experiences, as well as to glean how this learning and growth occurs. Data for this study was drawn from 66 interview transcripts and consisted of sections coded simultaneously for influences and learned outcomes. The cross-coded data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. The types of influences impacting students' ethical learning, and exemplars of how students report their lived experiences and ethical realizations, are discussed through the lens of what they learned and the mechanisms through which they gained these understandings. Our analysis suggests that several pre-college (e.g., extracurricular activities, service/volunteer roles and social experiences) and early college experiences (e.g., academic courses, part-time employment) play a critical role in shaping students' ethical perspectives. We more specifically present our findings organized around eight types of experiences and influences, which are in turn related to three categories of learned outcomes and three types of learning mechanisms. As we discuss in more detail below, the results of this study will likely be of interest to engineering educators, policymakers, and researchers with an interest in administering and studying high-impact ethics interventions for undergraduate engineering students. More specifically, our results underscore the importance of being more aware of how students' background perspectives and experiences likely play important roles in enabling or disabling their further ethical development. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.",Conference Paper,

Recent work has extended the crystallographic reconstruction of parent austenite in steels to include the reconstruction of special boundaries, such as annealing twins. These reconstructions present unique challenges, as twinned austenite grains share a subset of possible daughter variant orientations. This gives rise to regions of ambiguity in a reconstruction. A technique for the reconstruction of twin boundaries is presented here that is capable of reconstructing 60° <1 1 1> twins, even in the case where twin regions are comprised entirely of variants that are common between the twin and the parent. This technique is demonstrated in the reconstruction of lath martensitic steels. The reconstruction method utilizes a delayed decision-making approach, where a chosen orientation relationship is used to define all possible groupings of daughter grains into possible parents before divisive decisions are made. These overlapping, inclusive groupings (called clusters) are compared to each other individually using their calculated parent austenite orientations and the topographical nature of the overlapping region. These comparisons are used to uncover possible locations of twin boundaries present in the parent austenite. This technique can be applied to future studies on the dependence of post-transformation microstructures on the special grain boundary content of parent microstructures. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Interpreting the well-known B̄ projection in two different ways we develop two formulations for locking problems in beams and nearly incompressible elastic solids. One formulation leads to a sparse symmetric system and the other leads to a sparse non-symmetric system. To demonstrate the utility of Bézier projection for both geometry and material locking phenomena we focus on transverse shear locking in Timoshenko beams and volumetric locking in nearly compressible linear elasticity although the approach can be applied generally to other types of locking phenomena as well. Bézier projection is a local projection technique with optimal approximation properties, which in many cases produces solutions that are comparable to global L2 projection. In the context of B̄ methods, the use of Bézier projection produces sparse stiffness matrices with only a slight increase in bandwidth when compared to standard displacement-based methods. Of particular importance is that the approach is applicable to any spline representation that can be written in Bézier form like NURBS, T-splines, LR-splines, etc. We discuss in detail how to integrate this approach into an existing finite element framework with minimal disruption through the use of Bézier extraction operators and a newly introduced dual basis for the Bézier projection operator. We then demonstrate the behavior of the two proposed formulations through several challenging benchmark problems. © 2018",Article,"['Bézier dual basis', ' Bézier extraction', ' Bézier projection', ' B̄-projection', ' Isogeometric analysis', ' LockingExtraction', ' Finite element method', ' Geometry', ' Incompressible flow', ' Stiffness matrix', ' Displacement-based method', ' Dual basis', ' Isogeometric analysis', ' Locking', ' Nearly incompressible', ' Optimal approximation', ' Sparse non-symmetric systems', ' Spline representation', ' Locks (fasteners)']"

This development is a critical component for enabling fixed-wing aircraft to use a novel methodology called relative navigation. Relative navigation allows a single vehicle to gracefully accommodate intermittent GPS or geo-registered image updates. It can also enable communication and a computationally feasible cooperative, batch-based navigation approach for numerous vehicles. This paper presents a visual-odometry estimator that is appropriate for fixed-wing flight characteristics and sensing requirements. We propose a modification to the multi-state-constraint Kalman filter which, instead of running the filter in a single inertial/global frame, regularly resets the navigation frame to a new local origin. The vehicle operates based on the most recent keyframe and produces a marginalized change in pose (odometry) and covariance output whenever the keyframe is updated. This allows the front end to operate at the IMU rate to accommodate guidance and control inputs while sharing marginalized keyframe-to-keyframe odometry estimates with a back-end, graph optimization at a much lower rate than traditional batch navigation schemes. Results from testing the proposed method in a high-fidelity simulation of the filter is also presented. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,

After twin initiation, the twin boundary migrated toward the plastic-deformed grain interior to reduce the stored energy.

When water that is saturated with air is used as the working liquid, the non-wetted cavities on the superhydrophobic surfaces act as nucleation sites and allow air to effervesce out of the water and onto the surface when heated. Previous works in the literature have only considered the opposite case where the water is undersaturated and absorbs air out the cavities for a microchannel setting. The microchannel considered in this work consists of a rib/cavity structured superhydrophobic surface and a glass surface separated by spacers. The microchannel is 60 mm long by 14 mm wide and two channel heights of nominally 183 μm and 366 μm are explored. The superhydrophobic side is in contact with a heated aluminum block and a camera is used to visualize the flow through the glass side. Thermocouples are embedded in the aluminum to record the temperature profile along the length of the channel. Temperatures are maintained below the boiling temperature of the working liquid. The friction factor-Reynolds product (fRe) is obtained via pressure drop and volumetric flow-rate measurements. Five surface types/configurations are investigated: smooth hydrophilic, smooth hydrophobic, superhydrophobic with ribs perpendicular to the flow, superhydrophobic with ribs parallel to the flow, and superhydrophobic with ribs parallel to the flow with several breaker ridges perpendicular to the flow. The surface type/configuration has a significant impact on the mass transport dynamics. For surfaces with closed cell micro-structures, large bubbles eventually form and adversely affect fRe and lead to higher temperatures along the channel. When degassed water is used, no bubble nucleation is observed and the air initially trapped in the superhydrophobic cavities is quickly absorbed by the water. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"['Convection', ' Heat transfer', ' Mass transfer', ' Microchannel', ' Nucleation', ' SuperhydrophobicAluminum', ' Aspect ratio', ' Flow rate', ' Glass', ' Heat convection', ' Heat transfer', ' Laminar flow', ' Mass transfer', ' Microchannels', ' Nucleation', ' Surface properties', ' Thermocouples', ' Boiling temperature', ' Bubble nucleation', ' High aspect ratio', ' Super-hydrophobic surfaces', ' Superhydrophobic', ' Temperature profiles', ' Transport dynamics', ' Volumetric flow rate', ' Hydrophobicity']"

As the use of alternative project delivery methods increases, the perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages to using a particular method have matured. This paper reports on a national study of over 80 transportation owners and designers to measure their perceptions of the three most widely used delivery methods: design bid build (DBB), construction manager at risk (CMAR), and design build (DB). The study develops a list of factors that influence the selection of a delivery method, and then tests the most significant factors that lead to the selection of each individual method. Analyses using Fisher's least significant difference intervals and multiple range tests allow for the identification of specific correlations between the delivery method and motivating factors or project goals. The analyses show that delivery method selection is motivated primarily by project urgency, cost, and risk allocation. For the three main delivery methods of DBB, CMAR, and DB, motivation for their selection is primarily based on cost, risk allocation, and project urgency, respectively. User perceptions align with findings from literature in terms of schedule performance, but do not align in terms of cost performance.

They are demonstrated as individual joints and in mechanisms such as a kaleidocycle (a 6R Bricard linkage), degree-4 origami vertices (spherical mechanisms), and waterbomb base mechanisms (an 8R multi-degrees-of-freedom origami-based mechanism). © 2018 by ASME.",Article,

Flexural compression strength is usually greater than axial compression strength, and a reasonable experimental data set supports this assertion. However, little information exists for high-strength concrete block masonry subjected to combined axial and flexural loadings. This paper presents axial and flexural compression strengths and deformation properties of high-strength concrete block masonry. Seventy-two masonry prisms were constructed and tested to evaluate the capacity and behavior of high-strength structural masonry subject to compressive concentric and eccentric loading; both grouted and hollow prisms were used. Block strengths of 44, 56, and 67 MPa are considered. The results show an increase of flexural compression strength of 15-29% for the hollow prisms and of 70-79% for the grouted prisms compared with their axial compression strength. Measured ultimate strain varies from 0.14 to 0.19% for the axial compression and from 0.20 to 0.25% for the flexural compression.

Pollutants often accumulate to unhealthy concentrations during winter inversion events like those that commonly occur in the state of Utah and other mountainous regions. Electric vehicles (EV) are a potential solution to reduce harmful tail-pipe emissions that accumulate during inversions. This work represents a systems-level analysis of the degree to which replacing internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE) with EVs would reduce the near-road accumulation of criteria pollutants. The analysis draws on vehicle miles travelled data from major highways in Utah, vehicle fuel efficiency data, EPA-specified vehicle pollution emission standards, and local weather pattern trends. It employs two models, built in MATLAB and the agent-based modeling environment NetLogo, to determine pollutant concentrations, accumulation, and dispersion rates. These results are processed to determine changes in the Air Quality Index (AQI) caused by adjusting the percentage of EVs present within the vehicle population. The analysis concludes that replacing a significant percentage (80-100%) of the existing, fossil-fuel powered vehicle population with EVs would improve local AQI by 13 points. During extreme inversion events in Utah, these reductions would delay AQI levels from reaching 'red,' or unhealthy, status for enough time to allow local weather patterns to shift and dissipate the inversion event and accompanying pollution. Such a drastic reduction in AQI translates into better adolescent and elderly health and could minimize the risk of early onset asthma and other respiratory illnesses in regions negatively affected by high traffic pollution and winter inversion events. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,

The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of forefoot strike (FFS) and rearfoot strike (RFS) running patterns on foot kinematics and kinetics, from the perspectives of the midtarsal locking theory and the windlass mechanism. Per the midtarsal locking theory, we hypothesized that the ankle would be more inverted in early stance when using a FFS, resulting in decreased midtarsal joint excursions and increased dynamic stiffness. Associated with a more engaged windlass mechanism, we hypothesized that a FFS would elicit increased metatarsophalangeal joint excursions and negative work in late stance. Eighteen healthy female runners ran overground with both FFS and RFS patterns. Instrumented motion capture and a validated multi-segment foot model were used to analyze midtarsal and metatarsophalangeal joint kinematics and kinetics. During early stance in FFS the ankle was more inverted, with concurrently decreased midtarsal eversion (p < 0.001) and abduction excursions (p = 0.003) but increased dorsiflexion excursion (p = 0.005). Dynamic midtarsal stiffness did not differ (p = 0.761). During late stance in FFS, metatarsophalangeal extension was increased (p = 0.009), with concurrently increased negative work (p < 0.001). In addition, there was simultaneously increased midtarsal positive work (p < 0.001), suggesting enhanced power transfer in FFS. Clear evidence for the presence of midtarsal locking was not observed in either strike pattern during running.

Fiber optic sensors are known for their ability to survive in harsh environments such as high pressure and temperature like those within oil/gas wells, or high vibration like those with electromagnetic railguns. As these sensors become commercially available, one challenge is overcoming multiple noise sources simultaneously in the sensor and its network imposed from the harsh environment. Optical amplifiers are typically used in fiber optic sensors to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This method is suitable for boosting the signal above the floor caused by electrical noise. However, certain noise sources in fiber optic sensors directly modulate the optical signal. This can be due to other measurands being induced on the system. For example, while a slab coupled optical sensor (SCOS) is sensitive to electric field, it is also inherently sensitive to strain; therefore, any strain noise imposed on the sensor would overwhelm the electric field measurement and be considered noise. In this chapter, optical phase induced interference noise (PIIN) in a sensor network is reduced by using optical phase modulation in both a SCOS and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG). Strain induced noise on the optical fiber sensor is reduced using a differential sensor setup called a push-pull SCOS. Phase modulation and differentiation are then combined to allow for simultaneous noise reduction from different noise sources and allow for optical sensing of electric fields in harsh environments. These principles are applicable to other types of fiber optic sensors and sensors in general. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Book Chapter,"['Fiber optic sensors', ' Noise reduction', ' Phase modulationElectric field measurement', ' Electric fields', ' Fiber amplifiers', ' Fiber Bragg gratings', ' Fiber optics', ' Fibers', ' Noise abatement', ' Optical signal processing', ' Phase modulation', ' Rail guns', ' Sensor networks', ' Signal to noise ratio', ' Differential sensors', ' Electromagnetic rail guns', ' High-pressure and temperatures', ' Interference noise', ' Multiple noise sources', ' Noise reduction technique', ' Optical phase modulation', ' Test and evaluation', ' Fiber optic sensors']"

A bi-directional interface was developed between a VR design review environment and a commercial CAD package that streamlines the data translation process. Transmitting both geometric data and selected metadata from the CAD system enabled the development of enhanced model interaction tools in a VR design review application.

As a consequence, optimal higher-order convergence rates can be achieved without the need for an expensive shared master/slave segmentation step. We also develop weakly continuous geometry as a particular application of isogeometric Bézier dual mortaring. Weakly continuous geometry is a geometry description where the weak continuity constraints are built into properly modified Bézier extraction operators.

Interactions between the flexible polymer matrix and conductive particles dispersed throughout it produce a voltage signal under dynamic strain, which correlates to the magnitude of impact. Though promising in applications requiring both impact sensing and energy absorption, NCF's voltage response has been observed to suffer from significant signal drift. This paper investigates several causes of variance in the response of NCF sensors to consistent impacts. These effects can be classified into three general types: recoverable transient effects (such as those relating to viscoelasticity or capacitive charging), environmental drift (due to humidity and temperature), and permanent signal decay from material degradation. The motivation for the study arises from various potential repeat-impact applications where periodic recalibration of the sensor would be difficult (such as a gait-tracking insole in use for a marathon event). A cyclic drop testing machine was used to apply consistent impacts to NCF, and drift resulting from each factor (in ranges typical of an insole environment) was experimentally isolated. Models representing each factor's contribution to signal drift are presented. Of the factors investigated, humidity and temperature caused the most significant drift, with permanent material degradation accounting for only minor decay in voltage response. Transient effects were also observed, with a characteristic 'warm-up' (or 'charging') time required for the NCF to achieve steady-state; this phenomenon, and the related 'recovery' time for the material to return to its original state, were determined.

This is due to their low inertia and inherent ability to more safely interact with the world without damaging themselves or the people around them. However, existing sensing for soft robots has at least partially limited their ability to control interactions with their environment. Tactile sensors could enable soft robots to sense interaction, but most tactile sensors are made from rigid substrates and are not well suited to applications for soft robots which can deform. In addition, the benefit of being able to cheaply manufacture soft robots may be lost if the tactile sensors that cover them are expensive and their resolution does not scale well for manufacturability. This paper discusses the development of a method to make affordable, high-resolution, tactile sensor arrays (manufactured in rows and columns) that can be used for sensorizing soft robots and other soft bodies. However, the construction results in a sensor array that exhibits significant amounts of cross-talk when two taxels in the same row are compressed. Using the same fabric-based tactile sensor array construction design, two different methods for cross-talk compensation are presented. The first uses a mathematical model to calculate a change in resistance of each taxel directly. The second method introduces additional simple circuit components that enable us to isolate each taxel electrically and relate voltage to force directly.

Currently, there is no standard method for measuring the social impact of these types of products. As a result, engineers have used their own metrics, if at all. Some of the common metrics used include products sold and revenue, which measure the financial success of a product without recognizing the social successes or failures it might have. In this paper, we introduce a potential universal metric, the product impact metric (PIM), which quantifies the impact a product has on impoverished individuals - especially those living in developing countries. It measures social impact broadly in five dimensions: health, education, standard of living, employment quality, and security. By measuring impact multidimensionally, it captures impacts both anticipated and unanticipated, thereby providing a broader assessment of the product's total impact than with other more specific metrics. The PIM is calculated based on 18 simple field measurements of the consumer. It is inspired by the UN's Multidimensional Poverty Index (UNMPI) created by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The UNMPI measures how level of poverty within a nation changes year after year, and the PIM measures how an individual's poverty level changes after being affected by an engineered product. The PIM can be used to measure social impact (using specific data from products introduced into the market) or predict social impact (using personas that represent real individuals).

To accommodate the local traffic needs of high accessibility and efficiency, an increased number of signalized intersections and accesses have been installed. However, the absence of a defined hierarchical road network, together with irregular signal spacing and access density, tends to deteriorate arterial safety. Previous studies on arterial safety were generally based on a single type of road entity, either intersection or roadway segment, and they analyzed the safety contributing factors (e.g. signal density and access density) on only that type of road entity, while these suburban arterial characteristics could significantly influence the safety performance of both intersections and roadway segments. Macro-level safety modeling was usually applied to investigate the relationships between zonal crash frequencies and demographics, road network features, and traffic characteristics, but the previous researchers did not consider the specific arterial characteristics of signal density and access density. In this study, a new modeling strategy was proposed to analyze the safety impacts of zonal roadway network features (i.e., road network patterns and road network density) along with the suburban arterial characteristics of signal density and access density. Bayesian Conditional Autoregressive Poisson Log-normal models were developed for suburban arterials in 173 traffic analysis zones in the suburban area of Shanghai. Results identified that the grid pattern road network with collector roads parallel to arterials was associated with fewer crashes than networks without parallel collectors.

They also argue that existing recommender systems operate fundamentally different for long tail products than for mainstream goods. While matrix factorization, nearest-neighbors, and clustering work well for the ""head"" market, the long tail is better represented by a graph; specifically a bipartite graph that connects a set of users to a set of goods.

This paper presents results for small-scale n-heptane pool fire experiments near a slope, showing how flame shape and heat flux are influenced by slope angle, slope boundary condition and distance from flame base. Flames near slopes leaned toward the slope, and at some slope angles the flames attached to the slope. The average angle at which the effects of slope were noticeable was between 10° and 45°, depending on the criteria used. No difference was observed between a bare slope and an insulated slope. Dimensional analysis showed that important characteristics of flame attachment on slopes in the small-scale experiments were in the range estimated for the large fires.

Since energy absorption is dependent upon the unique stress-strain response of each foam specimen, it is difficult to quantify analytically; thus, energy absorption cannot be easily compared across materials.

Such methods require large amounts of time and money to characterize a narrow range of foams. This paper facilitates foam selection by deriving generalized energy absorption material indices. Assuming Euler buckling of columns in the open-cell foam structure, this paper applies equations derived by Maiti et al. to a typical impact scenario wherein the indices are extracted. Using existing Ashby charts, these indices allow polymers to be ranked by the mass and cost each would require as a foamed structure to satisfy specific energy absorption constraints.

This research applied and measured the impact of using surrogates to quickly model the stresses on a compressor blade. By modeling distinct points on a finite element (FE) model with unique surrogates, the stress field of the entire FE model was quickly predicted. This required that the distinct points remain in the same relative location on each blade used in training the surrogate. This research studied the ability of mesh morphing, and using the surface nodes as those distinct points, to satisfy this requirement. The results show that mesh morphing performed well on the tested compressor blades. The research also found that the surrogate accuracy depended not only on the number of training samples, but also the number and types of parameters being emulated. The surrogate models achieved less than 5% error on all the tested blades. Finally, the method provided a 96% decrease in time required for a structural iteration of a compressor blade. Such speeds eliminate bottlenecks that may occur in the structural design process. The combination of mesh morphing and surrogate modeling in compressor blade analysis enables exploration of various geometric parameters and their effect on structural responses.

However, the ability to rapidly assess the performance of these design concepts, with sufficient fidelity, is a current weakness of this nascent industry. This paper explores the capacity of the viscous Vortex Particle Method (VPM) to model wake interactions found in distributed propulsion. The elements of the vortex particle method are summarized, and a new approach for the calculation of vortex stretching through the complex-step derivative approximation is presented. Preliminary validation is performed on vortex ring cases resembling the fundamental dynamics encountered in propeller wakes. Unsteady wake dynamics of individual propellers are successfully modeled, replicating the instabilities that lead to vortex breakdown as observed experimentally. Comparing the method with results from momentum theory, it is shown that VPM is consistent with theoretical values of near and far field induced velocities, and a notable feature is its ability to model near/far field transition. Furthermore, VPM is able to fully characterize induced velocities across the entire wake, from the stable region where momentum theory operates, through instability transition and eventual vortex breakdown. The simulation of a multirotor configuration of two tip-to-tip propellers is shown, displaying the capacity of VPM to model wake mixing. The results presented here are intermediate steps in the development of a mid-fidelity modeling tool for the early design stages of distributed-propulsion electric aircraft. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Determining the end of primary consolidation is greatly exacerbated for layered soils that compress at varying rates. This paper discusses the use of magnet extensometer instrumentation to isolate compression within specific subsurface layers and associated techniques for estimating the time of construction induced settlement. Field data is used during construction to estimate the end of construction induced subsurface compression, which greatly affects the project schedule. This case study briefly summarizes instrumentation installation, data gathering, and the challenges associated with projecting the time of construction settlement. Two different curve fitting techniques were evaluated in this research: using standard primary consolidation equations and finite difference equations for estimating the end of primary consolidation settlement. For the site investigated, the curve fitting techniques proved to be somewhat problematic because the soil layers had small magnitudes of settlement and the transition between primary and secondary settlement was not readily apparent during the evaluation of real time field data. Using the finite difference equations also proved somewhat problematic trying to fit the full record of field data based on all of the different stages of loading. Additional lessons learned include the need for effective project communication between contractors, designers, and owners and a corresponding open discussion regarding practical settlement risk. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

A comprehensive SR-HALE aircraft multidisciplinary design optimization framework is developed in which the exible aircraft analysis tool ASWING is incorporated in order to constrain nonlinear aeroelasticity. Energy, battery, ply thickness, material failure, local buckling, aerodynamic stall, longitudinal stability, and general stability (including utter) constraints are applied in order to reasonably constrain the optimized SR-HALE aircraft design.

A further 21% reduction in total aircraft mass is found through the use of high modulus carbon fiber reinforced polymer. Significant decreases in aircraft mass, down to a total aircraft mass of 250.6 kg, are found to be possible if altitude requirements for SR-HALE aircraft are lowered from 18;288m to 16;764 m.

While fuel based propulsion technologies typically increase in specific power with increasing size, electric propulsion is typically much more scalable. This system scalability enables alternative designs including distributed propulsion, optionally powered propulsion units, and vectored thrust, which can all contribute to better runway performance and range. In this paper, we explore how continuously powered distributed propulsion can reduce takeoff distance while still satisfying range constraints. We use a combination of a blade element momentum method, a vortex lattice method, experimental data, and nonlinear optimization techniques to model and explore the design space. We have found that for this conceptual design study, a fully blown wing with propellers at the optimal diameter for the load (8 propellers for a 300 km range constraint) can reduce the takeoff distance by over 80% when compared to the optimal 2 propeller case using the same models. There is over a 2x increase in the wing lift coefficient which leads to a 36% reduction in liftoff speed. Also, the optimal fully blown case produced 2.9 more thrust during takeoff with only an 11% increase in total aircraft mass. Using propeller tip speed as a surrogate for noise, we found that the propeller tip speed decreased takeoff performance in an exponential manner: the tip speed could be decreased from Mach 0.8 to Mach 0.5 with only a 2x increase in takeoff rolling distance while decreasing the constraint to Mach 0.3 produced an 8x increase. © 2018, (publisher Name).

We directly model a superdirective antenna in receive mode by calculating streamlines of Poynting vector field near the receiving antennas. Superdirectivity is achieved by expanding the shape of the effective area beyond the antenna physical aperture area. The degree of superdirectivity is parameterized by an effective area expansion distance.

Complex Problem Solving studies and Cognitive Load Theory suggest information reduction as a way to grasp the critical aspects of a problem and move beyond the impasse inherent with too much information. Segmentation and chunking are common strategies for information reduction but the abstraction inherent in the chunking process provides better conceptual understanding. The simplified but meaningful results from the chunking process can then be leveraged to create a model or framework that helps students organise and clarify what they have observed as well as point to new opportunities for design activity.

A theoretical definition of a taste term should have a declaration of: 1) aesthetic purpose, 2) the essential emotional responses, and 3) understandable themes and expressions. A small group of second-year industrial design students explored the model, and was tasked with identifying, defining, and experimenting with three taste terms of their choosing: Performance, Strength, and Simple Quiet. To test their knowledge, they applied their aesthetic insights to a simple industrial design problem. Even though the original intent was to explore and define concepts of taste, and expand visual and verbal vocabulary for students, it was anecdotally observed that this exercise had a positive effect on creative output. This article will summarize the results of their efforts, and offer suggestions for future work regarding understanding the more granular context of taste terms. © Common Ground Research Networks, Richard Fry, All Rights Reserved.",Article,

As they increase in prevalence, how UAVs interact with each other and their environments will become increasingly important. The UAV air traffic control system will play an important role in keeping UAV-human interactions safe, effective, and efficient. The large number of automated agents, and the complex interactions between them, make this air traffic control system unusually complex. In this paper, the authors consider how the vertical distribution of UAVs affects an air traffic control system’s safety and efficiency. Several possible frameworks are examined, including a free-flight system in which UAVs are allowed to distribute themselves within the entire airspace; a stratified system where different layers are used for travel in different directions, and a compromise system where layers are specified, but vertical course deviation for conflict avoidance is permitted. Investigations are made into how prioritizing some UAVs over others in a hierarchy (for instance, giving emergency services UAVs a separate layer, independent of recreational or commercial users) could affect this system. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

As a result of active control of the welding temperature and/or cooling rate, FSW has the capability of fabricating steel joints with excellent toughness and strength. For example, unfavorable phase transformations that usually occur during traditional welding can be avoided and favorable phase fractions in advanced steels can be maintained in the weld zone thus avoiding the typical property degradations associated with fusion welding.

Structures comprised of origami tessellations offer a means to achieve angular cavities that approach black-like behavior during collapse by exploiting use of the cavity effect. Expanded origami surfaces exhibit intrinsic radiative properties while collapsed surfaces exhibit increasingly black-like behavior as the cavity aspect ratio increases. Actuation of such surfaces provides the means to achieve any apparent radiative behavior between these two extremes. This work explores the use of three origami structures (finite V-groove, hinged V-groove and Miura-ori) and their respective apparent radiative properties as a function of cavity geometry using Monte Carlo ray tracing. Results are presented as a function of tessellation geometry and degree of actuation (i.e. collapse). Ray tracing models are benchmarked with V-groove geometries for which analytical models exist in the literature. Convergence for ray independence was determined to be satisfactory when the standard error of the mean for every test case was less than 0.005. Deviation in the apparent absorptivity for finite V-groove relative to the infinite V-groove is quantified. The apparent absorptivity of the Miura-ori fold exhibits sensitivity to the fold geometry when the angle of the unit cell is varied, but is relatively insensitive to the length ratio of the panel. The variable nature of the net radiative heat transfer, achievable through actuation, affords a method for thermal management of components with variable heat dissipation and/or variable radiative environments. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

This work presents data structures based on origami that can be used in the automation of thick-origami mechanism design. These structures are described and an example computer program that implements them is investigated. The program automatically generates all the necessary 3D CAD part models and an assembly model for a user-specified origami crease pattern. Models resulting from the program for several crease patterns are demonstrated with a discussion of the advantages and limitations of the system.

CVI results from incompetent venous valves. The purpose of venous valves is to prevent retrograde blood flow to the lower limbs. Valve failure can lead to edema, pain, and ulcers. One solution that has great potential is to create an implantable venous valve that could restore function of the venous system. No prosthetic venous valves are clinically used currently because of problems with biocompatiblility and thrombogenicity caused by high shear rates. This paper presents a prosthetic venous valve that could overcome these difficulties by using carbon-infiltrated carbon nanotubes (CI-CNTs). This material has been proven to be thrombo-resistant, biocompatible due to its non-reactive properties, and durable. The valve was designed to be initially open and to close with physiological pressures. Finite element modeling showed that, with a hydrostatic pressure of 20 mmHg (the minimum hydrostatic pressure in the common femoral vein), it fully closed with a maximum stress of 117 MPa, which is below the ultimate strength of CI-CNTs. A computational fluid dynamics analysis demonstrated the valve would cause a maximum shear rate of 225.1 s− 1, which is less than the maximum shear rate in the body. Hence, this valve would be less likely than previous prosthetic valves to develop blood clots. Currently, this is the lowest shear rate reported for a prosthetic venous valve. These results demonstrate that a CI-CNT prosthetic venous valve has the potential to be an effective treatment for CVI. Copyright © 2018 ASME.",Conference Paper,

Control can be maintained while moving the particle with air speeds up to 2 m/s. A desire to greatly increase the sweep speed motivates a re-examination of the fundamentals of photophoresis-based laser-particle traps. Most explanations offered are qualitative, with differing opinions as to whether, for example, asymmetric heating or asymmetric thermal accommodation is primarily at work. Which particles become trapped in the beam is typically based on self-selection, as a variety of particles with possible differing shapes and sizes are offered to the laser focus for capture. Characteristics that make some particles preferred over others are especially relevant. There is broad consensus that structure in the laser focus greatly aids in stable trapping. Nevertheless, it is still possible for even a relatively smooth TEM00 beam to capture and hold particles. Moreover, even in a structured focus (i.e. with aberrations and local intensity minima and maxima), questions remain as to exactly how a particle becomes stably trapped in certain beam locations.

Given human expectations about how a path balances such tradeoffs, the path should match the human's intent throughout the entire execution of the path even if the environment changes. If the path drifts from the human's intent because the environment changes, then a new robotic-path needs to be planned - referred to as path-replanning. We discuss here three system-initiated triggers (prompts) for path-replanning. The objective is to create an interactive replanning system that yields paths that consistently match human intent. The triggers are to replan (a) at regular time intervals, (b) when the current robotic path deviates from the user intent, and (c) when a better path can be obtained from a different homotopy class.

While simple architecturally, this causes phase differences between estimates that must be calibrated through use of a reference receive channel.

DPT testing was performed using an automatic hammer with the energy specified in the Chinese standard and with an SPT hammer. In general, comparisons suggest that standard energy corrections developed for the SPT can be used for the DPT. The DPT correctly predicted liquefaction and non-liquefaction at these two test sites.

Detailed information about the magnitude of distortion and the shape of the distortion profile and how it changes through blade rows increases the understanding of flow physics and helps predict aerodynamic performance. Using full annulus URANS simulations, this paper analyzes what happens to distortion as it passes through the rotor and stator blade rows at 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% span. Fourier distortion descriptors are used in this study to quantitatively describe distortion transfer and generation. With these descriptors, evidence of pressure-induced swirl is shown at the fan inlet. It is also shown that although there is very little distortion at the 10% span of the inlet, after passing through the rotor blade row the 10% span has the greatest amount of total pressure and total temperature distortion. This radial migration of distortion is attributed to the high hade angle of the hub. The total pressure and total temperature profiles have significant circumferential phase shifts after passing through the rotor and slight phase shifts after passing through the stator. In general, the calculated phase shifts are greatest at the 10% and 90% spans, the nearest locations to the hub and the tip clearance gap, respectively. Copyright © 2018 ASME.",Conference Paper,

It can be difficult to predict the transfer of distortion through a compressor because traditional experimental and computational methods are very expensive and time consuming. The Harmonic Balance approach is a promising alternative which uses Fourier techniques to represent fluid flow solutions. Relatively little work has been done to assess how much Fourier information is necessary to calculate a sufficiently accurate solution with the Harmonic Balance Solver. This study focuses on analyzing the effects of varying the amount of modal content that is used in Harmonic Balance simulations. Inlet distortion profiles with varying magnitudes are used in order to analyze trends and provide insight into the distortion flow physics for various inlet conditions. The geometry is a single stage axial compressor that consists of an inlet guide vane followed by the NASA Stage 37 rotor. It is shown that simulations with greater magnitudes of distortion require more modal content in order to achieve sufficiently accurate results.

While the individual masonry components can be considered isotropic at the material level, masonry assemblages are anisotropic at the structural level. These properties of masonry make it difficult to develop models that accurately describe the material behavior for all analysis and design scenarios. One analysis tool that is efficient and reliable is the use of stress fields. Stress fields are based on the lower-bound theorem of the theory of plasticity. Stress fields have been combined with the truss analogy to produce what is known as the strut-and-tie modelling procedure. This article presents ongoing research that has the objective to develop strut-and-tie modelling procedures for masonry. The presented methodology uses the existing strut-and-tie guidelines for reinforced concrete as starting point and applies that methodology to the modelling of several masonry shear walls with openings. The shear strength predictions from the proposed strut-and-tie modelling methodology are shown to perform well compared to the experimental strengths.

The results of these tests were used to validate the finite element model. The finite element model was developed using VecTor2. The numerical response is in good agreement to measured response.

The tensile pull-out strength of the composite rebar embedded in concrete was measured and compared to steel rebar. Fiberglass/epoxy is less likely to corrode than steel rebar, ensuring more sustainable concrete structures in infrastructure applications. The 0.5"" diameter composite rebar was produced by pulling hundreds of strands of unidirectional fiberglass/epoxy towpreg to form the core of a cylindrical rod. The rods were consolidated by overwrapping strands of aramid fiber under tension in a spiral fashion, and cured using the manufacturer's (TCR Composites) recommended 250°F cure cycle. Configurations manufactured and tested included tow variations of aramid overwrap (dry and prepreg) with and without sand coating embedded in concrete cubes (8""x8""x8""). The results are compared to baseline values obtained by testing traditional steel rebar and commercially-Available fiberglass composite rebar. The tensile pull-out (bond) strength was quantified using a test fixture in accordance with ACI 440.3R-12. Measurements were collected at both the free and loaded ends of the rebar, with freeend results yielding a more accurate indication of rebar bond stress. The bond strength of the in-house manufactured fiberglass/epoxy rebar was comparable to steel rebar and commercial fiberglass composite rebar. The sand coating increased the surface roughness, improving the bond strength of the composite rebar by margins of 43-58% percent. Fiberglass/epoxy composite rebar consolidated with prepreg aramid tow and subsequently coated with sand resulted in a bond strength slightly higher, but comparable to steel.

The annular space between the pile and the sleeve is typically filled with uncompacted pea gravel. Designers often assume that the lateral resistance of the pile within the sleeve will be minimal; however, no test results are available to confirm this assumption. To investigate the lateral resistance of piles driven within CMS, a full-scale lateral load test was performed. The test pile configuration included a 32.4 cm (12.75 in.) pipe pile within a 60 cm (24 in.) CMS with uncompacted pea gravel filling the annular space. Results indicate that after small pile displacements, the lateral pile resistance was similar to that provided by an individual pipe pile and was even greater at larger displacements. As the pile displaced laterally, the gravel within the annular space became engaged and displaced the CMS into the compacted fill. Back-analyses indicate that the ultimate lateral pile resistance for this case can be approximated by treating the pipe-gravel-CMS as a composite pile having an EI equal to the pipe pile but with a diameter equal to the CMS. © ASCE.",Conference Paper,

If different turbine hub heights and rotor diameters are included in the same wind farm, the wake interference in the farm will be reduced, resulting in a lower cost of energy (COE) than a farm with identical turbines. In this paper, we present a method to model wind farm COE in farms with hub heights and rotor diameters that vary across the wind farm. We also demonstrate how to optimize these wind farms to minimize COE. The results show that COE can be greatly reduced in wind farms with non-homogeneous turbines, especially when the turbines are spaced close together. For a unidirectional wind rose, including different turbine design in the wind farm has a similar decrease in COE to spreading the wind turbines farther apart. When the rotor diameter and hub height of the wind turbines in a farm are optimized uniformly, a COE decrease of 4% to 13% (depending on the grid spacing and wind shear exponent) is achieved compared to the baseline. When the rotor diameter and turbine heights are optimized non-uniformly, with two different diameters and heights throughout the farm, there is a COE decrease of 22% to 41% compared to the baseline. For a more spread wind rose with a dominant probability from the west, there is a COE decrease between 3% and 10% for uniformly optimized rotor diameter and height compared to the baseline. With two optimized rotor diameters and heights through the farm, a COE decrease of 3% to 19% is achieved. For a similar wind rose shifted such that the dominant wind direction is from the northwest, a COE decrease between 3% and 10% results from uniformly optimized wind turbines compared to the baseline.

Engineering education has begun to attempt to prepare students for this environment. An important topic is how to best form teams of students for distributed design projects. The goals of this research were to validate a method for organizing teams to maximize team performance and identify and validate metrics for individuals that would help in the organization of distributed teams of student engineers. A review of previous, related research is provided. A description of the proposed method of team organization is given, along with methods of data collection and a comparison of the proposed method to common methods. How students were divided into teams and each team's method of organizing sub-teams are described. Use of online surveys, tests, statistical methods, and other data gathering and analysis methods are explained. Statistical analysis of survey results and qualitative results of interviews and observations suggest that a profile-based method for organizing teams results in significantly higher team satisfaction. Some methods for measuring and/or predicting individual attributes related to teamwork, such as the significance of participation in team sports, were validated. No correlation was found between which university a student attended and a student's level of satisfaction with his or her team.

This new viewpoint succeeds in eliminating the need for SOQPSK to be thought of as a “special” kind of correlated, ternary continuous phase modulation (CPM). Instead, SOQPSK can be viewed as an ordinary, binary CPM. We provide all of the details necessary to achieve a complete unification of SOQPSK models at the waveform level, at the bit sequence level, and in terms of waveform initialization.

Previously a detailed model was developed for soot formation depicting the soot particle size distribution using the method of moments with interpolative closure. This model is both accurate and complex. Computational expense of this model may be beyond many large-scale simulations. As a result, a simplified version of this detailed model has been developed. This simplified model makes two easy assumptions to drastically reduce the complexity of modeling soot formation. First assumption is that soot particles and soot precursors within a computational domain are assumed to be mono-dispersed, meaning all particles are the same size. This reduces the number of resolved terms to model both soot precursors and soot particles to three resolved terms rather than the 10+ terms required by the previously developed model. Second assumption is that all particles are spherical. While the simplified model is computationally less expensive, these two assumptions come with a cost in accuracy. Presented is both the development of this simplified model along with comparative simulations where the complex and simple models are ran. From these simulations, researchers and developers can justify which model may be used in their respective systems. © 2018 Western States Section/Combustion Institute.

Six engine power conditions ranging from 25% to 150% engine thrust request were measured using a 71-microphone linear ground array located approximately 8 m from the estimated shear layer. Mixing noise trends with engine power for the round-nozzle F-35B are similar to those of a nominally rectangular-nozzle high-performance jet aircraft [Harker et al, AIAA, 2016]. Cross-correlation and coherence measures are used to corroborate and confirm identifications of fine- and large-scale turbulent mixing noise contributions from a concurrent study of the F-35B dataset [Neilsen et al., AIAA, 2018]. The relationships observed between multiple spatiospectral lobes seen in the maximum radiation regions of prior and concurrent high-performance aircraft noise studies [Leete et al., AIAA, 2018] are confirmed and expanded upon. Correlograms help identify how the multiple spatiospectral lobes have different apparent phase speeds across the array, corresponding to different directionality, some components of which also change with engine power. Increased overlap of lobes with increased engine power appears to drive global decreases in field coherence. Finally, the structure of the spatiospectral lobes appears to be more visible in nondimensionalized coherence length than in the spectrum itself. Broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN) is found in the upstream direction at engine powers of 75% engine thrust request and above. Coherence is also used to separate BBSAN from jet mixing noise because the BBSAN is coherent within the relevant frequency range while adjacent fine-scale mixing noise is not. However, correlation and coherence analyses show that the upstream BBSAN signature is related to sound received in the peak radiation region dominated by the spatiospectral lobes. Possible links between the shock-associated noise and the spatiospectral lobes are discussed. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Synchronous measurements along a linear ground array approximately parallel to the shear layer were used to image the entire field through multisource statistically optimized near-field acoustical holography (M-SONAH). The field in the direction of maximum radiation consists of multiple lobes in the spatiospectral domain, which are manifest as multiple local maxima in space for a fixed frequency or multiple peaks in the spectra at a fixed location. Multiple lobes are observed at non-afterburning and afterburning engine conditions. As frequency increases for a given engine power, lobes appear towards the sideline and shift aft until they disappear beyond the measurement aperture and new lobe(s) take their place. As engine power is increased at a fixed frequency, the forwardmost lobe increases in its relative contribution to the field, which is a major contributing factor to the forward shift in overall directivity with increasing engine power. Field reconstructions and data in the forward direction outside of the region of maximum radiation show the presence of broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN) for 75% ETR and above.

The primary noise sources originate from interactions between turbulent mixing noise associated with large and finescale turbulent structures and the ambient air. A nonideally expanded jet also contains broadband shock-associated noise. A three-way decomposition of the spectral density measured near a tied-down F-35B quantifies the contribution from each type of noise. The decomposition is performed on noise from a ground-based, linear array of microphones, approximately 8 m from the estimated shear layer, which spanned an angular aperture of 35° to 152° (relative to engine inlet). This large spatial aperture allows for a detailed investigation into the spatial variation in broadband shock-associated noise and fine and large-scale turbulent mixing noise. The spectral decompositions match the measured spectral levels with three main exceptions: 1) the F-35B noise contains multiple spectral peaks in the maximum radiation region, 2) nonlinear propagation increases the high-frequency spectral levels, and 3) the low-frequency levels in the maximum radiation region are less than those predicted by the large-scale similarity spectrum. The main peak of the F-35B broadband shock-associated noise, evident from 35°-70°, has the same characteristic shape and variation in peak frequency as overexpanded, laboratory-scale jets. The F-35B broadband shockassociated noise peak level and width exhibit different trends than laboratory-scale BBSAN and those recently reported for the F/A-18E [Tam et al., Journal of Sound and Vibration, Vol. 422, 2018, pp. 92-111].

The overall sound pressure levels and spectra are shown for the two scenarios, as well as indicators of nonlinear propagation and shock content, specifically the derivative skewness and average steepening factor. The overall sound pressure level is reduced in the peak radiation direction aft of the aircraft but increased in the forward direction. The peak frequency of the noise is relatively unaffected by flight effects, though the amplitude of each frequency may vary. The increase in level in the forward direction results in shock formation that is absent during ground run-up measurements. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

New fiber optic sensors with ruggedized construction and non-electrical components are subjected to accelerated aging tests and deployed in several installations with long service life. An overview of current progress with fiber optic technology is provided for fatigue monitoring, temperature, pressure, and strain sensing. Recent developments include improved service life, novel bonding methods, pipeline sensor station improvements, sensor calibration, and long-term fatigue analysis. The latest advancements are validated on multiple installations on a subsea tieback in the deepwater Mississippi Canyon of the Gulf of Mexico at 6, 500 ft depth. A prior third-party sensor design experienced multiple non-recoverable sensor failures. A new sensor station design is employed on two Flowline Terminations to monitor pressure and temperature at a rate of 100 Hz. Subsea tiebacks are susceptible to flow assurance issues caused by plugging events such as hydrate formation. The system was originally designed to track pig location but transitioned to pressure and temperature sensing. An issue with the transition was the lack of calibration relating the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain levels to the actual process conditions. A novel method is presented for in situ adjustment of the sensor array calibration. During the calibration procedure, the sensors produced unanticipated results during pipeline flow shut-in and later startup operations. The sensors helped uncover a configuration of the flowline and sensor locations that is valuable for detecting hydrate forming conditions at a key junction location. The sensors are located before and after the junction of two flowlines in the mixing zone of the pipeline streams. The novel contributions of this study are the high speed data collection, in situ fiber optic calibration, review of advancements in fiber optic sensing technology, and a field case study with multiple sensing arrays. The developments are part of the Clear Gulf study, a collaboration between the offshore energy industry and NASA that was formed in 2010. The objective of the Clear Gulf study is to employ space technology and testing facilities for use in the upstream industry to advance subsea sensor technology. The highly sensitive monitoring systems developed as part of this study are used to give early warnings for flow assurance issues, structural failures, or catastrophic events.

According to previous studies, there are two possible factors: the Mach waves, which are radiated from the free-jet region and reflected by the plate, and the acoustic waves generated in the impingement region. To distinguish the effects of these factors, this study compares the following three results: the overall sound pressure level distribution, images extracted from the schlieren visualization movies using acoustic-triggered conditional sampling, and tracing lines of the acoustic intensity vectors of the Mach waves. The results reveal that the nozzle–plate distance affects the fraction of the Mach waves that are generated in the free-jet region and reflected by the plate, resulting in a higher overall sound pressure level in the upstream direction for larger nozzle–plate distances. It is concluded that the location of the plate relative to the source region of the Mach waves significantly affects the acoustic phenomena, owing to the variation in the nozzle–plate distances.

A major cause for this concern arises from the fact that implementation of security protections occur at a local scale, while the important operational security issues stem from a global perspective of the system, e.g., mission assurance. Being able to understand network-wide implications of local cyber protections has the potential to significantly impact the strategies we use to protect modern mission systems. In this work, we present a graph-theoretic perspective on this problem, which is based on a framework for modeling and assessing the integrated cyber-physical dynamics of complex systems. Under the framework, these dynamics (and their relationships) are modeled as a graph and then analyzed using processing techniques from graphtheory. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by conducting insider-attack threat analysis and show how the application of security protections at a local scale impact network-wide security properties from an insider perspective. As a test case, we study the problem of search and rescue (SAR) using unmanned aerial vehicle teams. Unmanned vehicle teams engaged in SAR are prototypical cyber-physical systems, in which local intrusions may cause global disruptions. Here, we describe how the insider modeling framework for cyber-physical dynamics applies to this problem and present results of a network-wide assessment of security properties of the system. We use this assessment to design a security protection for the system in which we use cryptographically secure computation techniques to limit the amount of information sharing required between system components without degrading the correct operation of the system. We show how the application of these techniques on a local scale impacts the security properties of the system on a global scale. © 2018 SPIE.",Conference Paper,"['cybersecurity', ' graph-theory', ' insider threat', ' multiparty computation', ' simulation', ' state inferenceAntennas', ' Complex networks', ' Computation theory', ' Cryptography', ' Cyber Physical System', ' Dynamics', ' Embedded systems', ' Graph theory', ' Cyber security', ' Insider Threat', ' Multiparty computation', ' simulation', ' state inference', ' Network security']"

Two mortars were tested, with volume proportions of cement, lime and sand of 1:0.5:4 and 1:1:6. Two specimen heights, 50 and 140 mm, with diameter of 45 mm, resulting in diameter/height ratios of 1.0 and 0.3, respectively were used. The experimental results indicated that the confinement and strength of the mortar influence its stress-strain behavior: the larger the confinement, the more the non-linear behavior. In addition, the results indicated that the Poisson's ratio and the tangent modulus of elasticity vary with increasing applied load. A numerical model was developed that accounted for the observations from the experimental phase with a nonlinear elastic phased analysis, which updates the modulus of elasticity and the Poisson's ratio at each new phase.

It was developed to establish suitable teaching practice to educate students on efficient design methods in a distributed product realisation projects in conjunction with an industrial partner. Students work in international teams formed from multiple partner universities. Communication is primarily through video-conferencing and other synchronous and asynchronous means of communication to perform design tasks including the vision, conceptual design, detail design and prototyping. Students ultimately meet during the final workshop at the end of the course to assemble and test prototypes and to disseminate their work to the company and wider public. The CODEVE methodology was tested in the Erasmus+ funded project called Networked Activities for Realisation of Innovative Products (NARIP) from 2015-2107. It has been implemented in academic institution in Europe. This paper discusses applicability of this methodology in the project which connects universities and industry across the Atlantic. Three universities are participating this year: Brigham Young University from Utah, USA with Industrial Design students, University of Technology and Economics of Budapest in Hungary with product design students and City, University of London from the UK with mechanical, aeronautical and electrical engineering students. The industrial partner is Black Diamond, a global company based in Utah, USA, while the manufacturing of prototypes and final workshop are hosted at City, University of London.

(Ref: OMAE2017-61494 Development and Testing of a Friction-Based Post-Installable Sensor for Subsea FiberOptic Monitoring Systems [1]). The prototype fiber-optic monitoring system collects a wide range of real-time data, which can be used to determine structural loading, fatigue, temperature, pressure, and flow assurance on operational platforms. The primary challenge of a post-installed instrumentation monitoring system is to ensure secure coupling between the sensors and the structure of interest for reliable measurements. Friction-based coupling devices have the potential to overcome installation challenges caused by marine growth and soil contamination on subsea structures, flowlines, or risers. This particular design solution is compatible with structures that are suspended in the water column and those that are resting on the seabed. In addition, the system can be installed by commercial divers in shallow depths or by remotely operated vehicles in deep-water applications. Operational limitations of the initial design concept were identified in the previous series of tests (2016-2017), and several innovative enhancements have been implemented which resulted in significant improvements in sensor system coupling and strain measurement correlation with traditional strain measuring devices. This paper provides a summary of the notable prototype design changes, full-scale test article buildup, and detailed performance data recorded during tension and compression loading that simulated representative offshore conditions. The test results were positive and demonstrated the effectiveness of the design enhancements. Compromises made during mounting of the sensing elements resulted in better performance in tension than compression. These effects are well understood and are fully discussed, and do not influence the viability of the design changes. This study is part of a continuing collaboration between the Houston-based NASA-Johnson Space Center and Astro Technology, Inc. within a study called Clear Gulf. The primary objective of the Clear Gulf study is to develop advanced instrumentation technologies that will improve operational safety and reduce the risk of hydrocarbon spillage.

Their thermal property information is limited, lacking experimental data on key properties such as thermal conductivity, specific heat, and CTE of the component fiber. This paper presents, for the first time, the thermal property data on kenaf fiber reinforced composites, and an approach to obtain the composite thermal properties based on constituent properties. Individual, plant-based fibers were measured independently and were then used to inform successful predictions of the effective thermal conductivity of the fiber reinforced composites. A unit cell model has been developed to predict the thermal properties of a planar, randomly oriented kenaf fiber-reinforced composite (near 22% volume fraction loading), which includes the effect of void content on the predicted thermal conductivity. A lower-level model is also developed for individual fiber thermal properties based on its constituents (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose). To validate this multi-level model, experimental measurements of the thermal diffusivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, and specific heat for the composite, the matrix, and the fibers were performed in the range from 30 °C to 160 °C, based on TMA, DSC, LFA, and transient electro-thermal (TET) techniques. Model results compare favorably with the experimental data, and are consistent with FEM modelling results based on fiber properties and fiber constituent materials (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose). This approach provides the basis for understanding component contribution to the fiber properties, as well as a technique to obtain fiber composite thermal property based on component properties.

One such technology is the novel CO2-Binding Organic Liquid (CO2BOL) process developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The process utilizes their anhydrous CO2BOL solvent in place of amine mixtures to reduce the energy penalty. A full-scale model of this system based on NETL's Case 10 power plant is projected to produce 7-16% more net electric power over a traditional MEA system for the same plant. These full-scale model predictions are promising, however full-scale simulations are difficult to validate using only bench-scale data. There are errors in both the measurements and models that need to be considered in addition to uncertainties introduced by up-scaling. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a statistical framework used to better understand these uncertainties as well as data gaps in models. By constraining models to data, distributions of model parameters are estimated and then propagated through the model to obtain distributions of key outputs such as carbon capture percent, energy penalty, stripper temperature, etc. The results from this UQ analysis aid the design of experiments (DoE) which identifies data gaps to fill to improve model accuracy. Using UQ and DoE effectively can reduce the development time of new carbon capture by years and save time and money on the path to a pilot, and ultimately full-scale, plant.

Sustainability concerns apply to many critical resources such as water. On a per capita basis, the U.S. leads the world in water usage, with a substantial portion of water consumed/leaked by infrastructure systems. Because of water availability, competing water demands, and changing hydrologic conditions, the U.S. Department of Interior predicts that multiple water conflicts will occur in the western U.S. by 2025. In addition, decades of excessive demands on ecological systems have reduced their capacities to absorb and process emissions and wastes. Sustainable water infrastructure is vital to providing the American public with clean and safe water and helping to ensure the environmental, economic, and social health of the nation's communities. The increasing interest in sustainability has led to the development of sustainability assessment tools such as life cycle assessments (LCA) analyzing the embodied energy and environmental impacts. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool used to identify the environmental impacts of a product, process, or activity over the entire lifespan of the product. LCA studies also quantify and interpret the environmental flows to and from the environment (including emissions to air, water, and land, as well as the consumption of energy and other material resources) over the entire life cycle of a product (or process or service).

Water main break rates are calculated for all pipe materials used in water delivery to create a measurement to judge pipe performance and durability. Water main break rates can vary year to year and by utility. However, in aggregate, break rates produce a compelling story which can aid our prudent decision making as it relates to repairing and replacing our underground pipes.

Inhaled corticosteroid is a popular medication for treating chronic respiratory diseases. Its side effects include decreased bone mineral density and osteoporosis. The aims of this study are to investigate the association of inhaled corticosteroids and fracture and to design a clinical support system for fracture prediction. The data of patients aged 20 years and older, who had visited healthcare centers and been prescribed with inhaled corticosteroids within 2002-2010, were retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). After excluding patients diagnosed with hip fracture or vertebrate fractures before using inhaled corticosteroid, a total of 11645 patients receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy were included for this study. Among them, 1134 (9.7%) were diagnosed with hip fracture or vertebrate fracture. The statistical results showed that demographic information, chronic respiratory diseases and comorbidities, and corticosteroid-related variables (cumulative dose, mean exposed daily dose, follow-up duration, and exposed duration) were significantly different between fracture and nonfracture patients. The clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) were designed with integrated genetic algorithm (GA) and support vector machine (SVM) by training and validating the models with balanced training sets obtained by random and cluster-based undersampling methods and testing with the imbalanced NHIRD dataset. Two different objective functions were adopted for obtaining optimal models with best predictive performance. The predictive performance of the CDSSs exhibits a sensitivity of 69.84-77.00% and an AUC of 0.7495-0.7590. It was concluded that long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids may induce osteoporosis and exhibit higher incidence of hip or vertebrate fractures. The accumulated dose of ICS and OCS therapies should be continuously monitored, especially for patients with older age and women after menopause, to prevent from exceeding the maximum dosage. © 2018 Yung-Fu Chen et al.",Article,

GIS (geographic information system) helps to empower a utility with the tools to drive a robust and strategic, decision making process. When a CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) has asset management functionality, the capabilities of service requests, inspections and work orders, capturing costs, and work history can be leveraged into asset condition and risk-based spatial analysis by determining what, when, why, and where the next round of investment should occur. A critical step in the process includes analyzing the data and location to potential take actions to reduce the risks. In alignment with ISO (International Standards Organization) 55000, risk is defined as the probability of failure (PoF) multiplied by the consequence of failure (CoF) which produces the business risk exposure (BRE). While calculating risk is important, the risk-based data can be used to build business cases and determine future projects. GIS can help users gain an understanding of what assets are high risk, where they are located and what factor can influence the risk. Risk-based analysis provides the reasoning for potential solutions and action.

The observed fan characteristics on Titan reveal some regions of high relative relief and others with gentle slopes over hundreds of kilometres, exposing topographic variations and influences on fan formation. There is evidence for a range of particle sizes across proximal to distal fan regions, from c. 2 cm or more to finegrained, which can provide details on sedimentary processes.

As the diffusion tensor model has limitations in brain regions with crossing fibers, novel diffusion MRI reconstruction models may offer more accurate measures of tissue properties, and a better understanding of the brain abnormalities in specific diseases. Here we studied a large sample of 249 participants with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a neurogenetic condition associated with high rates of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, and 224 age-matched healthy controls (HC) (age range: 8-35 years). Participants were scanned with dMRI at eight centers worldwide. Using a meta-analytic approach, we assessed the profile of group differences in four diffusion anisotropy measures to better understand the patterns of WM microstructural abnormalities and evaluate their consistency across alternative measures. When assessed in atlas-defined regions of interest, we found statistically significant differences for all anisotropy measures, all showing a widespread but not always coinciding pattern of effects. The tensor distribution function fractional anisotropy (TDF-FA) showed largest effect sizes all in the same direction (greater anisotropy in 22q11DS than HC). Fractional anisotropy based on the tensor model (FA) showed the second largest effect sizes after TDF-FA; some regions showed higher mean values in 22q11DS, but others lower. Generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) showed the opposite pattern to TDF-FA with most regions showing lower anisotropy in 22q11DS versus HC. Anisotropic power maps (AP) showed the lowest effect sizes also with a mixed pattern of effects across regions. These results were also consistent across skeleton projection methods, with few differences when projecting anisotropy values from voxels sampled on the FA map or projecting values from voxels sampled from each anisotropy map. This study highlights that different mathematical definitions of anisotropy may lead to different profiles of group differences, even in large, well-powered population studies. Further studies of biophysical models derived from multi-shell dMRI and histological validations may help to understand the sources of these differences. 22q11DS is a promising model to study differences among novel anisotropy/dMRI measures, as group differences are relatively large and there exist animal models suitable for histological validation. © SPIE.

A dataset of still images and associated gravity vectors was collected and used to perform supervised learning. The network builds on a previously trained network and was trained to be able to approximate the attitude of the camera with an average error of about 8 degrees. Flight test video was recorded and processed with a relatively simple visual odometry method. The aircraft attitude is then estimated with the visual odometry as the state propagation and network providing the attitude measurement in an extended Kalman filter. Results show that the proposed method of having the neural network provide a gravity vector attitude measurement from the flight imagery reduces the standard deviation of the attitude error by approximately 12 times compared to a baseline approach. © 2017 IEEE.,Conference Paper,

The Riedel equation has been considered to be an excellent and simple choice among vapor-pressure correlating equations [ Velasco et al. J. Chem.

Liquid heat capacity was predicted using these vapor-pressure correlations, and the best final coefficient values were chosen based on the ability to simultaneously represent vapor pressure and liquid heat capacity. This procedure improves the fit to liquid heat-capacity data by 5-10% (average absolute deviation), while maintaining the fit of vapor-pressure data similar to those of other prediction methods.

It is assumed that separate Kalman filters are employed by each sensor and no measurements of known landmarks are available. Accurate bias estimation is achieved through the use of pseudo measurements of slant range from each sensor to the target and pseudo measurements of each sensor's bias. The covariance intersection (CI) algorithm is used to produce a pseudo measurement of slant range. This pseudo measurement of range allows pseudo measurements of sensor bias to be calculated based on each sensor's residuals and Kalman gains. Substantially improved tracking performance is demonstrated when estimating and accounting for constant biases on each sensor. © 2017 IEEE.,Conference Paper,

Research questions: 1. Do professionals prefer plain style? 2a. Do preferences differ for different categories of style? 2b. Do preferences differ for different groups of workers? Literature review: Style, the word- and sentence-level elements in a written text, is a critical element of plain language. There is evidence that plain style, however, affects readers differently based on their level of subject matter knowledge. Plain style is even criticized by a few. There is a long history of tensions surrounding linguistic prescriptivism, the notion that one manner of language use is superior to all others. Further, readers' preferences for writing style, plain or otherwise, may not be consistent across occupational positions, education levels, nationalities, personality types, or genders. Research methodology: We conducted a quantitative study of preferences for two major style categories (conciseness and word choice) using an online survey instrument. The student-recruiter technique provided us with usable responses from 614 working adults in the US. Using that data, we calculated proportions of respondents, with confidence intervals, who chose the plain-style options. We also used statistical tests to explore associations between preferences and respondent characteristics. Results and conclusions: Our findings support an overwhelming preference for plain style among US professionals who are native speakers of English. Reader preferences were stronger for elements associated with word choice than with conciseness. Those with lower education levels and blue-collar occupations had lower preferences for plain style. The study had two major limitations: 1. We investigated only two aspects of plain style rather than the full range of elements that make up plain language. 2. Our data-collection instrument presented readers with an artificial rather than an authentic reading experience. Future research may investigate the role of personality on stylistic preferences and the attributions readers make about writers based on their style. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Article,"['Conciseness', ' language use', ' professional writing', ' word choice', ' writing styleBibliographies', ' Education', ' Electronic mail', ' History', ' Industrial relations', ' Instruments', ' Professional aspects', ' Conciseness', ' language use', ' Pragmatics', ' Word choices', ' Writing style', ' Teaching']"

In previous research, radiation mode expressions have been developed for planar and spherical structures, as well as axisymmetric modes of internal and external radiation from cylinders. In this work, the radiation modes for external radiating cylinders which account for both axial and circumferential dependence are presented. The expressions are uniquely developed using cylindrical basis functions which are a more natural match to the geometry than past developments, which have been based on spherical harmonics. Higher order radiation modes than have been previously presented are shown. The “leapfrog effect”, whereby higher order modes leapfrog over lower modes in terms of their radiation efficiencies as the frequency goes above the cut-on frequency for those modes, is discussed in detail. The relationships between the mode efficiency and the coincidence effect associated with the cut-on frequencies of the vibration modes are described. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"['Acoustic basis functions', ' Cut-on phenomena.', ' Cylindrical shell', ' Radiation mode shapesAcoustic radiators', ' Cylinders (shapes)', ' Efficiency', ' Functions', ' Shells (structures)', ' Acoustic radiation modes', ' Basis functions', ' Circular cylindrical shells', ' Critical design parameters', ' Cut-on phenomena', ' Cylindrical shell', ' Radiation efficiency', ' Radiation mode', ' Radiation']"

Losses for single antennas can be minimized using high conductivity materials. It is less well understood that loss for array antennas is also influenced by mutual coupling between array elements and the beamformer weights applied to the signal from each element. In this paper, we study the antenna loss and receiving efficiency for phased array antennas and focal plane phased array feeds. To better elucidate the physics of array antenna loss related to mutual coupling and beamformer weights, losses for a coupled array can be lumped into an array effective resistance similar to the loss resistance of an equivalent single antenna. Numerical results show that although the antenna loss for a single isolated array element is low, the array antenna loss can be significantly increased by mutual coupling, particularly for beams with a large scan angle. © 2017 IEEE.",Article,"['Array effective resistance', ' mutual coupling', ' phased array antennas', ' phased array feeds', ' receiving efficiency', ' scanned beamsAntenna arrays', ' Antenna feeders', ' Antenna radiation', ' Beamforming', ' Directional patterns (antenna)', ' Efficiency', ' Electric resistance', ' Radio astronomy', ' Radio communication', ' Receiving antennas', ' Satellite communication systems', ' Effective resistances', ' Loaded antennas', ' Mutual coupling', ' Phased array antennas', ' Phased array feeds', ' scanned beams', ' Antenna phased arrays']"

For infusion under a flexible membrane, such as vacuum infusion, or for simulation of a part with non-uniform thickness, one must test the permeability at various levels of compaction. This process is time consuming and often relies on interpolation or extrapolation around a few experimental permeability measurements. To accelerate the process of permeability characterization, a small number of methodologies have been previously presented in the literature, in which the permeability may be tested at multiple fiber volume contents in a single test. Some of the methods even measure the permeability over a continuous range of thicknesses, thus requiring no later interpolation of permeability values. A novel method is presented here for the rapid measurement of permeability over a continuous range of fiber volume content, in a single unidirectional vacuum infusion flow experiment. The thickness gradient across the vacuum bag, as well as the fluid pressure at several locations in the mold were concurrently measured to calculate the fabric compressibility. An analytical flow model, which accounts for the compressibility, is then used by iterating the fitting constant in a permeability model until the predicted flow front progression matches empirical measurement. The method is demonstrated here for two reinforcement materials: (1) a fiberglass unbalanced weave and (2) a carbon biax non-crimped fabric. The standard deviation across the multiple experiments for each material and flow orientation ranged from 12.8% to 29.7%. Validation of these results was performed by comparing the resulting permeability with multiple non-continuous permeability measurement methods. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Article,"['liquid composite molding', ' Permeability', ' vacuum infusionCarbon', ' Compressibility', ' Interpolation', ' Mechanical permeability', ' Molding', ' Optimization', ' Reinforcement', ' Empirical measurement', ' Fiber volume content', ' Liquid composite molding', ' Non-uniform thickness', ' Permeability measurements', ' Reinforcement materials', ' Thickness gradients', ' Vacuum infusion', ' Characterization']"

However, aside from avoiding enzyme active sites or protein-binding interfaces, distinguishing the optimal PEGylation site from the available alternatives has conventionally been a matter of trial and error. As part of a continuing effort to develop guidelines for identifying optimal PEGylation sites within proteins, we show here that the impact of PEGylation at various sites within the β-sheet model protein WW depends strongly on the identity of the PEG-protein linker. The PEGylation of Gln or of azidohomoalanine has a similar impact on WW conformational stability as does Asn-PEGylation, whereas the PEGylation of propargyloxyphenylalanine is substantially stabilizing at locations where Asn-PEGylation was destabilizing. Importantly, we find that at least one of these three site-specific PEGylation strategies leads to substantial PEG-based stabilization at each of the positions investigated, highlighting the importance of considering conjugation strategy as an important variable in selecting optimal PEGylation sites. We further demonstrate that using a branched PEG oligomer intensifies the impact of PEGylation on WW conformational stability and also show that PEG-based increases to conformational stability are strongly associated with corresponding increases in proteolytic stability. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Article,

Two MPC controllers are compared against two well-tuned PID controllers to obtain a direct comparison of MPC and current FSW controllers. One MPC controller uses a first-order plus dead-time (FOPDT) model derived from a simplified conduction-advection view of the stir zone. The other MPC controller uses the Hybrid Heat Source model that describes heat conduction in the plate and tool. At quasi steady-state conditions, all four controllers can easily hold temperature within 2 °C of the setpoint in the absence of large disturbances. Once the weld is past the initial traverse, the FOPDT controller is superior to the Hybrid Heat Source controller with regards to modeled-disturbance rejection and setpoint changes. The FOPDT controller is competitive with well-tuned PID controllers in this region of the weld. During the initial traverse, the Hybrid Heat Source controller and PID controller with regulator gains were able to control temperature within 5 °C of the setpoint, compared to a typical deviation of 20–30 °C when uncontrolled. During this period, the FOPDT controller and PID controller with servo gains could not maintain satisfactory temperature control. MPC is demonstrated to be a viable control method for FSW.

This system currently provides data summaries for several performance measures, one of them being turning movement counts collected by microwave sensors. As this system became public, there was a need to evaluate the accuracy of the data placed on the SPMs. A large-scale data collection was carried out to meet this need. Vehicles in the Hi-resolution data from microwave sensors were matched with the vehicles by ground-truth volume count data. Matching vehicles from the microwave sensor data and the ground-truth data manually collected required significant effort. A spreadsheet-based data analysis procedure was developed to carry out the task. A mixed model analysis of variance was used to analyze the effects of the factors considered on turning volume count accuracy. The analysis found that approach volume level and number of approach lanes would have significant effect on the accuracy of turning volume counts but the location of the sensors did not significantly affect the accuracy of turning volume counts. In addition, it was found that the location of lanes in relation to the sensor did not significantly affect the accuracy of lane-by-lane volume counts. This indicated that accuracy analysis could be performed by using total approach volumes without comparing specific turning counts, that is, left-turn, through and right-turn movements. In general, the accuracy of approach volume counts collected by microwave sensors were within the margin of error that traffic engineers could accept.

One cause of this problem is uncertainty regarding the actual requirements of customers in the developing world. This can result when designers, with experience in technologically advanced countries, apply their own value structure to the products they design. Because of the designers’ lack of experience in the culture and environment of the developing world, the actual requirements are only partially known to them. This problem can be mitigated by (i) optimizing product flexibility and adaptability to react to uncertain requirements, and (ii) reducing the most critical uncertainties. The flexibility of a product to adapt to new or changing requirements has been shown to extend the service life of large complex engineered systems (e.g., aircraft carriers, aircraft, communication systems, and space craft). These systems must remain in service for extended periods of time, even though the environments and requirements may change dramatically. Applying these proven techniques to products designed for the developing world can alleviate the problem of uncertain requirements. This paper presents and demonstrates a technique aimed at improving the success of developing world engineering projects. Flexibility and adaptability minimize the impact of uncertainties, and are enabled by numerically optimized amounts of designed-in excess.

In this paper we demonstrate that a custom digital light processor stereolithographic (DLP-SLA) 3D printer and a specifically-designed, low cost, custom resin can readily achieve flow channel cross sections as small as 18 μm × 20 μm. Our 3D printer has a projected image plane resolution of 7.6 μm and uses a 385 nm LED, which dramatically increases the available selection of UV absorbers for resin formulation compared to 3D printers with 405 nm LEDs. Beginning with 20 candidate absorbers, we demonstrate the evaluation criteria and process flow required to develop a high-resolution resin. In doing so, we introduce a new mathematical model for characterizing the resin optical penetration depth based only on measurement of the absorber's molar absorptivity. Our final resin formulation uses 2-nitrophenyl phenyl sulfide (NPS) as the UV absorber. We also develop a novel channel narrowing technique that, together with the new resin and 3D printer resolution, enables small flow channel fabrication. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by fabricating 3D serpentine flow channels 41 mm long in a volume of only 0.12 mm3, and by printing high aspect ratio flow channels &lt;25 μm wide and 3 mm tall. These results indicate that 3D printing is finally positioned to challenge the pre-eminence of methods such as soft lithography for microfluidic device prototyping and fabrication. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Article,

Nine subjects (5 male, 4 female) walked on a force-instrumented treadmill at 1.34 m/s for 120 s each while wearing a shoe that was instrumented with four NCPF sensors. GRF data, measured via the treadmill, and sensor data, measured via the NCPF inserts, were used in a tenfold cross validation process to calibrate a separate model for each individual. The calibration model estimated average anterior–posterior, mediolateral and vertical GRF with mean average errors (MAE) of 6.52 N (2.14%), 4.79 N (6.34%), and 15.4 N (2.15%), respectively. Two additional models were created using the sensor data from all subjects and subject demographics. A tenfold cross validation process for this combined data set resulted in models that estimated average anterior–posterior, mediolateral and vertical GRF with less than 8.16 N (2.41%), 6.63 N (7.37%), and 19.4 N (2.31%) errors, respectively. Intra-subject estimates based on the model had a higher accuracy than inter-subject estimates, likely due to the relatively small subject cohort used in creating the model.

The aims of this study were to explore the relationship between cam morphology and dGEMRIC values, and to explore whether baseline dGEMRIC can predict the development of radiographic hip osteoarthritis. Methods Prospective cohort (SibKids) study with clinical, radiographic, and MRI assessment at baseline and five-year follow-up (n = 34). The dGEMRIC values of cartilage regions were correlated with measures of cam morphology. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to baseline variables to predict radiographic loss of joint space width. Results Superolateral acetabular cartilage dGEMRIC values were significantly lower in participants with cam morphology (P < 0.001), defined as an alpha angle greater than 60°. There was a negative correlation between alpha angle and the dGEMRIC value of adjacent acetabular cartilage. This relationship was strongest superoanteriorly (r = −0.697 P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between baseline dGEMRIC and the magnitude of joint space width narrowing (r = 0.398 P = 0.030). ROC analysis of combined baseline variables (positive impingement test, alpha angle, dGEMRIC ratio) gave an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.75 for predicting joint space width narrowing greater than 0.5 mm within 5 years. Conclusions The size and position of cam morphology determines the severity and location of progressive cartilage damage, supporting the biomechanical aetiology of femoroacetabular impingement.

Upon free surface impact, an elastomeric sphere deforms significantly, giving rise to large-scale material oscillations within the sphere resulting in unique nested cavities. We study these phenomena experimentally with high-speed imaging and image processing techniques. The water entry behaviour of deformable spheres differs from rigid spheres because of the pronounced deformation caused at impact as well as the subsequent material vibration. Our results show that this deformation and vibration can be predicted from material properties and impact conditions. Additionally, by accounting for the sphere deformation in an effective diameter term, we recover previously reported characteristics for time to cavity pinch off and hydrodynamic force coefficients for rigid spheres.

This approach, however, suffers from a combinatorial explosion when the supercell size is large, when there are more than two atom types, or when there are many displaced atoms. This problem persists even when there are only a relatively small number of unique arrangements that survive the elimination process.

The Alamouti space-time block code is used to encode the phase states in the complex exponential representation of SOQPSK-TG. Because SOQPSK-TG possesses memory, the Alamouti decoder is a sequence estimator. Maximum likelihood and least squares sequence decoders are derived. To reduce the number of states, the eight-waveform cross-correlated trellis-coded quadrature modulation (XTCQM) approximate representation of SOQPSK-TG is used. A prototype decoder based on the least squares decoder and the estimators described in Part I and operating at a data rate of 10 Mb/s was tested in the laboratory in test flights at the Air Force Test Center, Edwards AFB. The test flights demonstrate that Alamouti-encoded SOQPSK-TG, as described in this paper, using the least squares decoder based on the estimators described in Part I solves the two antenna problem in aeronautical telemetry. © 2017 IEEE.",Article,

This extends the operational life of the robot by decreasing long term error during operation by as much as 50% of the steady state error at the end effector when compared to the same leak if our adaptation method is not used.

The objective is to design an all-electric aircraft optimized to carry as much weight as possible, while also minimizing the empty weight of the aircraft capable of successfully completing a flight circuit. A flight circuit is defined as flying completely around two safety cones for a total distance of about 726ft. The challenge has provided the team with the opportunity to improve design and manufacturing skills, while also gaining experience in real life engineering challenges. As a result, the team greatly increased their knowledge of aeronautical design and manufacturing. BYU-Idaho has developed a balsa/plywood carbon fiber reinforced fixed wing aircraft weighing approximately.7lbs, capable of carrying more than 4lbs. When configured for flight, its wings span 60in, and an overall length of 20.8in. Its wing can be broken down into three 20in segments. The aircraft is easily transported in a 6in diameter tube that is 20.3in in length. In order to maximize interior space and manufacturability, the fuselage was not streamlined.

This shift in computing expectations focuses on the ability to compute horizontally, performing the same tasks within different computing environments, as opposed to vertically, performing different tasks in the same computing environment. In this paper, we propose a method by which the usability of a given piece of software can be comparatively analyzed across all hardware platforms on which it is available. This methodology is based on the Majrashi and Hamilton's twelve factors of usability and has been extended to include specific applications and metrics for the following computing platforms: desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones. These metrics focus on collecting quantitative data about the usability of each platform. This quantitative data contrasts with recent studies which focus extensively on qualitative data regarding the user experience. Combining these two types of studies will allow researchers to capture a more comprehensive picture of software usability across computing platforms. The methodology has been validated by performing an initial study using the tasks and performance metrics across each of the defined computing platforms. The results from these initial tests have allowed us to make improvements to the testing methodology as well as some hypotheses for further testing. This proposed methodology, when used in conjunction with qualitative research, can provide a reliable approach for cross-platform usability analysis.

Although not exclusive to new faculty, the target audience and predominant attendees, were new faculty from the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines on campus. The three-day workshop focused on basic principles of effective learning and teaching, aligning learning outcomes to assessments and teaching activities, methods for active learning, and strategies for effective classroom presentation. The workshop curriculum was centered around the following goals: 1) promoting broader awareness of alternative teaching strategies for STEM classrooms, 2) increasing faculty comfort level in using alternative teaching strategies, 3) increasing adoption of active learning and other evidence-based pedagogies, 4) building a campus community dedicated to improving teaching, and 5) increasing multi-disciplinary collaborations amongst faculty attendees. The purpose of this paper is to provide an example of a model workshop designed to help new faculty engage students in STEM disciplines, and includes the planning, implementation, and assessment of this workshop. The paper begins by introducing the development of the workshop, including the logic model and assessment plan, the curriculum outline, and preparation processes. The paper also explores the implementation lessons learned. Finally, this paper includes the assessment results of the effectiveness of the workshop in meeting the workshop goals. This includes a preand post-workshop comparison of the participant's attitudes regarding evidence based pedagogies and their perceived competency in using them. This paper is useful for engineering educators in developing teaching expertise, researchers interested in faculty attitudes and perceived competency in using alternate teaching strategies, and faculty and administrators planning to create professional development opportunities to help faculty of all levels become more proficient in evidence-based pedagogies. This paper also serves as an example of a model workshop to develop interdisciplinary communities of educational practice, as well as strengthen the abilities of a new faculty in establishing an engaging and effective classroom. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",Conference Paper,

To conduct seismic risk assessment studies and to improve resilience of bridges, seismic vulnerability studies are required. The main objective of this study is to construct fragility curves of typical non-skewed highway bridges in Chile. The fragility curves are obtained from an incremental dynamic analysis of a two-dimensional model of the bent cap of a two-span simply supported underpass. As most bridges are constructed with seismic tie-down bars, their constitutive behavior was obtained experimentally. A total of five seismic bar specimens were tested to characterize their cyclic behavior in bridges with and without transverse diaphragms. The incremental dynamic analysis was performed with the two horizontal components of seven seismic records obtained from the Mw 8.8, 2010 Chile earthquake. Additionally, a parametric study is conducted to assess the seismic behavior of bridges with different configurations of seismic bars, with lateral stoppers, and with varying length of the transverse seat width. Results from this study reveal that seismic bars have a limited contribution to the seismic performance of the studied bridge, especially when lateral stoppers are incorporated. Additionally, the transverse seat width is found to be critical to reduce the collapse probability of the superstructure. The provided fragility curves may be used for seismic risk assessment and to evaluate possible improvements in seismic bridge design codes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"['Bearings', ' Bridge', ' Damage', ' Experimental analysis', ' Fragility', ' Incremental dynamic analysis', ' Seismic behaviorBearings (structural)', ' Bridges', ' Curves (road)', ' Dynamic analysis', ' Earthquakes', ' Geophysics', ' Losses', ' Risk assessment', ' Seismic design', ' Seismic response', ' Seismology', ' Transportation', ' Damage', ' Experimental analysis', ' Fragility', ' Incremental dynamic analysis', ' Seismic behavior', ' Highway bridges', ' bridge', ' cyclic loading', ' damage', ' dynamic analysis', ' experimental study', ' risk assessment', ' seismic design', ' seismic response', ' Chile']"

The Asset Score is based on simulated energy use under standard operating conditions. Existing weather normalization methods such as those based on heating and cooling degrees days are not robust enough to adjust all climatic factors such as humidity and solar radiation. In this work, over 1000 sets of climate coefficients were developed to separately adjust building heating, cooling, and fan energy use at each weather station in the United States. This paper also presents a robust, standardized weather station mapping based on climate similarity rather than choosing the closest weather station.

To address this issue we develop a multi-level reconstruction operator which maintains the locality properties of the projection. We also introduce a balance parameter to control the overlap of hierarchical functions leading to improved numerical conditioning.

We model this disease using the phase-field method and a set of diffusion–reaction equations to account for the dynamics of nutrients and a key biomarker termed Prostate Specific Antigen.

It uses measurement data to devise a family of reduced order nonlinear models while retaining physical interpretability of parameters and equations. The manifold boundary approximation method (MBAM) uses the Fisher information matrix calculated from measurements to identify the least relevant parameter combination in the original model. Next, it numerically constructs a geodesic on the corresponding statistical manifold originating from the initial parameters in the least relevant parameter direction until a manifold boundary is found. MBAM then identifies a limiting approximation in the mathematical form of the model and removes one parameter combination. The simplified model is recalibrated by fitting its behavior to that of the original model, and the process is repeated as appropriate. MBAM is demonstrated on the example of a synchronous generator (SG), which has been treated extensively in the literature.

This unique and widely-applicable cell delivery mechanism and strategy hold great promise for transforming cell therapy for refractory diseases. © 2017 The Author(s)",Article,"['Cell therapy', ' Endogenous TGase', ' Micro-scaffold capsule', ' Pathological liver', ' Targeted cell deliveryAmino acids', ' Cell culture', ' Cells', ' Chemical bonds', ' Cytology', ' Disease control', ' Medicine', ' Pathology', ' Stem cells', ' Cell delivery', ' Cell therapy', ' Endogenous TGase', ' Intraperitoneal injections', ' Mesenchymal stem cell', ' Micro-scaffold capsule', ' Regenerative medicine', ' Tissue transglutaminase', ' Scaffolds (biology)', ' glutamine', ' lysine', ' molecular scaffold', ' protein glutamine gamma glutamyltransferase', ' guanine nucleotide binding protein', ' macrogol derivative', ' protein glutamine gamma glutamyltransferase', ' protein glutamine gamma glutamyltransferase 2', ' acute liver failure', ' animal cell', ' animal experiment', ' animal model', ' anoikis', ' Article', ' cell adhesion', ' cell protection', ' cell therapy', ' cell viability', ' chemical binding', ' controlled study', ' ex vivo study', ' in vivo study', ' liver injury', ' mesenchymal stem cell', ' mouse', ' nonhuman', ' priority journal', ' animal', ' Bagg albino mouse', ' biocatalysis', ' chemistry', ' cytology', ' drug delivery system', ' human', ' injection', ' injuries', ' liver', ' mesenchymal stem cell transplantation', ' mesenchymal stroma cell', ' metabolism', ' microcapsule', ' nude mouse', ' pathology', ' tissue scaffold', ' Animals', ' Biocatalysis', ' Capsules', ' Cell Adhesion', ' Drug Delivery Systems', ' GTP-Binding Proteins', ' Humans', ' Injections', ' Liver', ' Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', ' Mesenchymal Stromal Cells', ' Mice, Inbred BALB C', ' Mice, Nude', ' Polyethylene Glycols', ' Tissue Scaffolds', ' Transglutaminases']"

This paper presents a novel approach that involves treating the team as a moldable volume, in which deformations of the volume correspond to changes in team shape.

During surround mode, the operator explores or manipulates the team shape to create desired formations around a building. A spacing interaction method also allows the operator to adjust how robots are spaced within the current shape. Separate haptic feedback is developed for each method to allow the operator to ""feel"" the shape or spacing manipulation. During travel mode, the operator chooses desired travel locations and receives feedback to help identify how and where the team travels. Results from a user study suggest that haptic feedback significantly improves operator performance in a reconnaissance task when task demand is higher, but may slightly increase operator workload.

Neither sustainable reservoir life spans nor intergenerational equity is achieved through conventional cost-benefit analyses (CBAs), which render all benefits and costs projected to occur more than several decades into a project as negligible. Consequently, future costs, including dam decommissioning or retrofitting with sediment management facilities, would be regarded as nonfactors in an analysis. CBAs have also historically failed to account for infrastructure and environmental impacts of sedimentation over time. Alternatives to the traditional application of the CBA do exist, however, such as dam owners instituting retirement funds or insurance policies, beneficiaries paying for rehabilitation or maintenance, and economists incorporating infrastructure damages and potentially logistic discount rates into their analyses. A brief case study of Gavins Point Dam shows that available information on damages due to a lack of sediment management account for 70% of the actual construction cost and would likely exceed construction costs if all damage information were available.

An extensive and detailed experimental program has been conducted on three-block high stack-bonded prisms, built using a combination of one hollow block type and three mortars with different strengths. Based on the results of the experiments, masonry failure was assessed. The main conclusion of this is that the mortar in all cases governs the masonry failure mechanism. The ratio between the masonry and block moduli of elasticity, which can be used as a measure of loss of stiffness, indicates that masonry built with a strong mortar behaves almost as a homogenous material. The typical failure mode observed during testing for this type of masonry was due to tensile stresses developed in the block. A crack developed at and propagated instantly through the block face until reaching the mortar bed joint; the crack then propagated through the head joint causing a localized split at the interface between block and mortar. For masonry built with two different weak mortars, as the stress/strength ratio increased, the ratio between the masonry and mortar moduli of elasticity decreased to 0.32 and 0.55, for the weak and the weaker mortar respectively. The observed failure mode, however, was independent of how weak the mortar was since, for both cases, the masonry failed due to localized mortar crushing. Another conclusion from the study presented herein is that a robust and reliable prediction of the masonry compressive strength requires the use of the nonlinear stress-strain relationship of the component materials. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"['Failure modes', ' Masonry prisms', ' Nonlinear behavior', ' Stiffness ratio', ' Stress-strain relationshipCompressive strength', ' Concrete construction', ' Concretes', ' Cracks', ' Elasticity', ' Failure (mechanical)', ' Failure modes', ' Mortar', ' Prisms', ' Stiffness', ' Stress-strain curves', ' Tensile testing', ' Concrete masonry prisms', ' Experimental program', ' Masonry prisms', ' Nonlinear behavior', ' Nonlinear stress-strain relationship', ' Stiffness ratios', ' Stress-strain behaviors', ' Stress-strain relationships', ' Masonry materials']"

As material in MFZ rotated around the probe, the fraction of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) was reduced, the ratio of twin boundaries increased, and the grain size distribution became wider, while the average grain size was fairly constant despite the increase in strain. After the material was deposited behind the probe, the grains began to grow. Deformation caused by tool shoulder disrupted the twin boundaries and generated some segments of LAGBs.

In the former, F→ 2 +, limit, the shallow water equations are formally approximated by a Korteweg-de Vries/Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KdV–KS) equation that is a singular perturbation of the standard Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation modeling horizontal shallow water flow. Our main analytical result is to rigorously validate this formal limit, showing that stability as F→ 2 + is equivalent to stability of the corresponding KdV–KS waves in the KdV limit. Together with recent results obtained for KdV–KS by Johnson–Noble–Rodrigues–Zumbrun and Barker, this gives not only the first rigorous verification of stability for any single viscous St. Venant roll wave, but a complete classification of stability in the weakly unstable limit. In the remainder of the paper, we investigate numerically and analytically the evolution of the stability diagram as Froude number increases to infinity. Notably, we find transition at around F= 2.3 from weakly unstable to different, large-F behavior, with stability determined by simple power-law relations.

Deposits of heavy fuel oil ash were created in the Turbine Accelerated Deposition Facility (TADF) at Brigham Young University under gas turbine-related conditions. Ash was produced by burning heavy fuel oil in a downward-fired combustor and collecting the ash from the exhaust stream. The mass mean ash particle diameter from these tests was 33 microns. This ash was then introduced into the TADF and entrained in a hot gas flow that varied from 1088 to 1206°C. The gas and particle velocity was accelerated to over 200 m/s in these tests. This particle-laden hot gas stream then impinged on a nickel base superalloy metal coupon approximately 3 cm in diameter, and an ash deposit formed on the coupon. Sulfur dioxide was introduced to the system to achieve 1.1 mol% SO2 in the exhaust stream in order to simulate SO2 levels in turbines currently burning heavy fuel oil. The ash deposits were collected, and the capture efficiency, surface roughness, and deposit composition were measured. The deposits were then washed with deionized water, dried, and underwent the same analysis. It was found that, as the gas temperature increased, there was no effect on capture efficiency and the post-wash roughness of the samples decreased.

The tracking method uses a monocular camera and makes no assumptions on the shape of the terrain or the target motion. The UAV runs two cascaded estimators. The first is an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is responsible for tracking the UAV's state, such as position and velocity relative to a fixed frame. The second estimator is an EKF that is responsible for estimating a fixed number of landmarks within the camera's field of view. Landmarks are parameterized by a quaternion associated with bearing from the camera's optical axis and an inverse distance parameter. The bearing quaternion allows for a minimal representation of each landmark's direction and distance, a filter with no singularities, and a fast update rate due to few trigonometric functions. Three methods for estimating the ground target positions are demonstrated: the first uses the landmark estimator directly on the targets, the second computes the target depth with a weighted average of converged landmark depths, and the third extends the target's measured bearing vector to intersect a ground plane approximated from the landmark estimates. Simulation results show that the third target estimation method yields the most accurate results. © 2017, Institute of Navigation.",Conference Paper,

Many large simulations today rely on inaccurate assumptions about particle compositions, including that the volatiles that are released during pyrolysis are of the same elemental composition as the char particle. Another common assumption is that the char particle can be approximated by pure carbon. These assumptions will lead to inaccuracies in the overall simulation.

FRP rebar is generally as strong as steel rebar, but less susceptible to corrosion, providing a significant advantage over traditional steel reinforcement in concrete structures. In this study, a variety of different design configurations of carbon/epoxy composite cylindrical rebar rods were manufactured, embedded in concrete, and tested in axial tension to identify the relationships between manufacturing parameters and tensile pull-out strength of the rebar. The rebar was produced by combining multiple tows of carbon/epoxy prepreg to form the core of cylindrical rods which were consolidated using various spirally-wound consolidation fibers. The rods were cured at 121 degrees Celsius as specified by the material manufacturer, TCR Composites. The manufactured rods were approximately 10.4 mm in diameter. Primary variables investigated included the consolidation fiber material (aramid, fiberglass and basalt), prepreg vs. dry consolidation tows, the number of tows used to consolidate the rebar (i.e., the size of tows used to consolidate the rebar). Larger consolidation tows were created by braiding three smaller tows together. The consolidation tows also served the purpose of providing the rebar with ribs similar to those on steel rebar to improve bonding. Select rebar samples were subsequently coated with sand to increase rebar surface roughness for improved bonding with concrete. The rebar was cast in 200 mm × 200 mm × 200 mm concrete cubes to investigate bond strength. The strength of the bond between concrete and FRP rebar was investigated using the pull-out test detailed by ACI 440.3R-12. A test fixture was manufactured to enable testing using a standard tensile testing machine. Standard 12.7 mm diameter steel rebar and a commercially comparable fiberglass rebar were also tested to provide baseline values. Results showed that the bond strength was below 344 MPa (50 ksi) when dry winding was used regardless of whether a single or a multiple tow consolidation bundle was used. Prepreg consolidation combined with sand resulted in a bond strength of 478 MPa (69.3 ksi), comparable to steel at 464 MPa (67.2 ksi). The results demonstrated that consolidating the rods with a wet tow resulted in a rebar which bonded better with concrete than using a dry tow. During testing, it was discovered that dry consolidating materials would easily strip off the rod due to poor bonding. Sand was shown to significantly increase the bond strength of the composite rebar, by more than 30 percent. This study provides the basis for a proposed new low-cost manufacturing method for composite rebar as structural reinforcement in concrete. These preliminary results allowed for a test matrix to be set up where FRP rebar bond strength could be investigated in detail using higher quality samples and more controlled parameters. © 2017 The Composites and Advanced Materials Expo (CAMX).

Literature review suggests that particle size and number density play a more critical role in determination of radiative properties than the complex index of refraction. Radiative data was produced from numerical experiments using one of two particle distribution profiles (narrow or wide). A comparison of highly forward scattering cases for two particle sizes (25μm vs. 75μm) revealed a significant difference in incident heat flux maximum (25%). This difference was observed in both profiles examined. It was also generally observed that as particle size increases the difference between incident heat flux for forward and backward scattering decreases. No significant difference was observed between the large diffuse sphere and no scattering cases, suggesting that accurate modelling of larger particle size distributions can be achieved while neglecting scattering and phase functions.

Mesh refinement in regions of high velocity gradients was shown to be the most critical factor in achieving realistic simulation results. In Case 5 where mesh refinement was focused near the geometric shapes of the cooling tubes and burner tile, insufficient mesh refinement existed in the fuel-air mixing zones around and above the burner to accurately predict fuel jet penetration and fuel-air mixing, resulting in inaccurate predictions for flame shape and heat flux profiles at the cooling tubes. Differences in predicted incident flux, total heat transfer and flame shape between the highest levels of mesh refinement (~2 million cells) between the structured trimmed-cell mesh and the unstructured polyhedral mesh were minimal. At lower mesh levels of 1 million cells, there were slightly greater discrepancies between the structured trimmed-cell mesh and the unstructured polyhedral mesh, particularly with respect to the flame shape and upper furnace flux profile predicted in Case 3. Interestingly, the differences in thermal efficiency and total heat transfer were greater between Case 2 and Case 1 (2 million versus 1 million cells) than between Case 2 and Case 5 (2 million versus 1 million cells with poor refinement). This trend was also observed with Case 4 and Case 3. This suggests both cell count and local mesh refinement are important to achieving accurate combustion predictions, but that there is minimal difference between the results with differing mesh types as long as the cell count and refinement are sufficient to represent the expected jet mixing behavior.

At the liquid-surface boundary of the spreading thin film, an isotropic hydrodynamic slip and temperature jump are imposed to approximate the SHPo surface boundary condition. Applying an integral analysis within the thin film results in a system of differential equations which are solved numerically to obtain local hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layer thicknesses, thin film height, and local and radially averaged heat flux. The classical smooth hydrophobic scenario with no-slip and no-temperature jump showed excellent agreement with previous differential analysis of the same problem. The influence of varying temperature jump length on the local Nusselt number was obtained over a range of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. Increasing temperature jump length results in a dramatic decrease in the local thermal transport near the impingement point. The greatest decrease occurs at small temperature jump lengths. Further, local and average Nusselt numbers are less influenced by the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers as temperature jump length increases. Overall, variations in the temperature jump length exert much more influence than variations in the hydrodynamic slip length. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"['Convective heat transfer', ' Jet impingement', ' Slip length', ' Superhydrophobic surface', ' Temperature jump lengthBoundary conditions', ' Boundary layer flow', ' Boundary layers', ' Heat convection', ' Heat flux', ' Hydrodynamics', ' Hydrophobicity', ' Jets', ' Liquids', ' Nusselt number', ' Polonium compounds', ' Prandtl number', ' Sulfur compounds', ' Surface properties', ' Thin films', ' Convective heat transfer', ' Jet impingement', ' Slip length', ' Super-hydrophobic surfaces', ' Temperature jump', ' Fighter aircraft']"

Pressure drop measurements in a rectangular channel with one superhydrophobic wall (cross-section approximately 0.37 × 10 mm) and three transparent hydrophilic walls were obtained. Data for air/water mixtures with superficial Reynolds numbers ranging from 22–215 and 55–220, respectively, were obtained for superhydrophobic surfaces with three different cavity fractions. Agreement between experimentally obtained two-phase pressure drop data and correlations in the literature for conventional smooth control surfaces was better than 20 percent, which is within the accuracy of the correlations. The data reveal a reduction in the pressure drop for two-phase flow in a channel with a single superhydrophobic wall compared to a control scenario.

While a large body of work exists on droplet impingement on hydrophilic and superhydrophilic surfaces, impingement on the latter two has been largely neglected and the present results show that dynamics are dramatically different. Experiments ranging in surface temperature from 125°C to 415°C and Weber numbers from 10 to 225 were performed and analyzed using high-speed imaging. Some of the most striking differences are as follows. While atomization is always present for impingement on the hydrophilic and superhydrophilic surfaces at temperatures below the Leidenfrost point, atomization is absent at low Weber numbers and at low excess surface temperatures on the hydrophobic surface. At high surface temperatures, the attraction of vapor bubbles on the hydrophobic surface allows a vapor blanket to form more readily thus leading to Leidenfrost behavior at a much lower temperature than classically observed on a hydrophilic surface. One of the most interesting phenomenon that will be discussed includes what will be described as a “pseudo-Leidenfrost” state for impingement on the superhydrophobic surface. Because water can be suspended at the peaks of the roughness on a superhydrophobic interface, vapor escapes from underneath the droplet thus mimicking Leidenfrost behavior for all excess temperatures. This results in minimal atomization for superhydrophobic impingement over the entire regime explored. Finally, maximum spread diameters for Leidenfrost impingement are tabulated as a function of the Weber number for all surfaces and are shown to be larger on the smooth surfaces than on the textured ones indicating that droplet spreading at the Leidenfrost point is not independent of surface type as previously supposed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"['Boiling', ' Droplet impingement', ' SuperhydrophobicAtmospheric temperature', ' Atomization', ' Boiling liquids', ' Drops', ' Hydrodynamics', ' Hydrophilicity', ' Phase interfaces', ' Surface properties', ' Wetting', ' Droplet impingement', ' Hydrophilic surfaces', ' Hydrophobic surfaces', ' Super-hydrophobic surfaces', ' Superhydrophilic surface', ' Superhydrophobic', ' Surface temperatures', ' Water droplet impingement', ' Hydrophobicity']"

LUVOIR (large, UV-optical-IR telescope) is a potential NASA flagship space-based observatory of the 2020's or 30's. It would utilize the largest mirrors ever flown1. Their reflective coating will almost certainly be aluminum, since such telescopes would profit from truly broad-band mirrors. To achieve reflectance over the broadest band, the top surface of such aluminum mirrors, however, needs to be bare, without the oxide layers that naturally form in air. This will open the 11 to 15 eV band. Since thin aluminum films are largely transparent between 15 and 70 eV an EUV mirror under the aluminum could make EUV bands such as 30.4 nm available for space-based astrophysics without sacrificing mirror IR, visible and UV reflectance. The local space environment for the observatory is sufficiently oxygen-free that the surface should remain bare for decades. We discuss protecting as-deposited aluminum mirrors with robust, oxygenimpenetrable, barrier layers applied in vacuo to the aluminum immediately after deposition and before air contact. The goal is that the barrier could also be cleanly, and relatively easily, removed once the mirror is in space. We propose hydrogen atoms as the means for removing the overcoat, since they can be expected to meet the criteria that the means is gentle enough to not roughen the mirror surface, and does not redeposit material on the mirror or other spacecraft components. We have investigated both organic and inorganic (such as, a-Si) hydrogen-removable films that can be applied to the aluminum immediately after its deposition have been investigated. We also examined the REVAP technique, using Cd and Zn. Agglomeration limited their effectiveness as barrier layers. That and dealing with the reevaporated atoms may limit their utility as barrier materials. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

For small UAS, the need is especially critical because of the clutter and the air-traffic density at low altitudes where they operate. For the community of researchers who are developing SAA technology for small UAS, there is a critical need for a rich, openly-accessible compendium of encounter data with which to develop, test, and evaluate SAA algorithms. In this paper we introduce a publicly available database of small UAS encounter data, the small aircraft flight encounter (SAFE) database, with an initial deposit of 11 flight encounters. In these encounters two target aircraft, a fixed-wing and a multi-rotor are imaged by a separate fixed-wing aircraft carrying two high-definition video cameras and a unique radar unit. The data contain ground-truth navigation estimates for both the target and imaging aircraft. The target aircraft are observed in the video footage but not in the radar imagery; continuing efforts include tuning and refinement of the radar parameters and expansion of the SAFE database to support small UAS SAA technology development. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The life-cycle benefit– cost analysis currently used by the Utah Department of Transportation is similar to the least reliable method. To provide a tool to perform the most reliable method defined by the HSM—the predictive method— this research developed a spreadsheet-based tool to allow department engineers to perform life-cycle benefit–cost analyses for the 11 roadway segment types included in the HSM. The tool can be used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of safety-related improvements identified by the Utah crash prediction model, which was previously developed to identify safety hot spots on the state highway system. The concept and the spreadsheet layout are presented by using the rural two-lane, two-way highway spreadsheet as an example. Then a case of a rural two-lane, two-way highway with two selected countermeasures is presented to demonstrate the use of this spreadsheet to compare their benefit–cost ratios. One important aspect associated with life-cycle benefit–cost analyses of safety-related improvements is the cost of implementing such improvements. Safety-related improvements are often included in larger construction contracts and such costs vary significantly, depending on the way they are included in the larger contracts.

The data offered by WDP technology has maximum benefit when applied in an automation system or as a real-time advisory tool. Improved control is demonstrated for Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) with the use of high-speed telemetry and physics-based models. Stabilizing and minimizing pressure within an acceptable bound leads to higher and more consistent Rate of Penetration (ROP). MPD control is challenging due to tight pressure windows and the nonlinearity of the choke and pump response on Bottom Hole Pressure (BHP). This work demonstrates a new Hammerstein-Wiener nonlinear model predictive controller for BHP regulation in drilling. Hammerstein-Wiener models employ input and output static nonlinear blocks before and after linear dynamics blocks and thereby simplify the controller design. The control performance is evaluated in scenarios such as drilling, pipe connections, and kick attenuation. A physics-based drilling simulator, WeMod, is used for model identification and control performance evaluation. The control performance of the new nonlinear controller is compared to conventional controllers in various scenarios. Because of the interconnected multivariable and nonlinear nature of the drilling operation, conventional controllers show severe limitations. In a first scenario, the performance of set point tracking during normal drilling operation is compared. By changing the set point of the BHP, the conventional controller manipulates only the choke valve opening while the nonlinear controller moves choke valve opening, mud pump, and back pressure pump simultaneously. In a second scenario, a pipe connection of a typical drillpipe stand is demonstrated. The conventional controller is not able to regulate the BHP by adjusting the choke valve only. Although a linear version of the controller is able to exploit multivariable relationships, absence of the nonlinear relationships results in severe oscillation when the operational range is shifted outside of the training region. The nonlinear controller maintains a BHP within ±1 bar of the requested set point. A third scenario investigates the kick attenuation performance of conventional and nonlinear control algorithms. The nonlinear controller attenuates the kick within well control conditions, without requiring a well shut-in procedure. Recent advances in drilling simulators and the reliability of the WDP data highway have enabled tighter BHP control. This study presents a robust method to control BHP by applying Hammerstein-Wiener models in an efficient model predictive controller. The proposed methods have been validated in the downstream industry, but are applied for the first time to drilling with nonlinear control functionality. The multivariable control adjusts three main manipulated variables in MPD simultaneously. Copyright © 2017, SPE/IADC Drilling Conference and Exhibition.",Conference Paper,

Frame-to-frame object movement can be approximated to a linear process making the Kalman filter algorithm the best option. Once an object is lost, its corresponding track is deleted along with its corresponding motion model. During tracking, an object may be occluded by other objects in the scene. The MOT metric is designed to evaluate the performance of an object tracker by considering the tracking continuity, distance error for each path, and the reliability of detection. Thus, only the position of the object is considered in generating the MOT metric. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method and prove that the SYBA descriptor works well with various image deformations.",Article,

The goal of this study was to better understand this behavior for abutments backfilled with both gravel and geosynthetic reinforced soil (GRS). Large-scale testing was performed with non-skewed and 30° skewed abutment configurations. Two tests were performed at each skew angle, one with gravel backfill and one with GRS backfill. The test abutment backwall was 3.35 m wide, non-skewed, and 1.68 m high and loaded laterally into the backfill. Both backfills exhibited greater passive resistance than sand backfills owing to increased internal friction angle and unit weight. Skew angle reduced the passive force in both cases by about 40%. The GRS backfills had reduced initial stiffness and only reached 79% to 87% of the passive force developed by the unreinforced gravel backfill. This reduction was considered to be a result of reduced interface friction at the geotextile-backwall interface due to wrapping. Reduced stiffness may be favorable for abutment configurations because it allows thermal movement without developing excessive induced stresses in the bridge superstructure. © ASCE.",Conference Paper,

These profiles are modulated using recycled flue gas that acts as the diluent normally served by nitrogen during air firing. The large amounts of recycled flue gas (RFG) required leads to efficiency losses, making the economics of this process less attractive. Oxy-coal combustion economics can be improved in advanced oxy-combustion processes that may involve zero or minimal RFG and possibly high combustion pressures. This paper addresses effects of high combustion temperatures resulting from minimal RFG, on ash aerosol formation and ash deposition mechanisms. Issues related to ash deposition play important roles in being able to predict overall boiler performance. Effects of high pressure will be reported in future work. A 100kW downfired laboratory combustor is used to compare ash aerosol formation and deposition under two conditions: 1) using 27% O2 in the inlet oxidant gas (denoted as OXY27), representing first generation oxy-combustion (heat transfer conditions similar to air firing for retrofit); 2) with 70% O2 in the inlet oxidant gas (denoted as OXY70), representing advanced oxy-combustion where the RFG is used only to transport the coal, not to modulate flame temperatures. The ash aerosol particle size distributions and its size segregated composition were determined using on-line electric mobility/light scattering analyzers and low pressure impactors, respectively. Their relationship to ash deposition rates as determined using a specially designed deposition probe was explored. The data show that, compared to the retrofit conditions of OXY27, the advanced oxy-coal combustion in OXY70 produce much higher concentrations of submicron particles due to increased mineral vaporization at the high flame temperature and the decreased flue gas flow rate. This appeared to lead to significant increases in deposition rates. Changes in the supermicron particle concentration were in line with those expected by the lower flue gas alone, suggesting that mineral fragmentation is not greatly affected by temperature. Deposition rates of both inside and outside deposits, as defined in earlier work, are interpreted in the light of recently developed hypotheses that point to the importance of the submicron particle ash concentration. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

However, aeronautical telemetry channels are in general consists of larger delay spreads which make the MMSE equalization of aeronautical channels with GTR-STBC computationally complex. Interestingly enough, in spite of larger delays aeronautical channels are made of few sparsely distributed multipaths and therefore their MMSE equalizers are highly compressible. In this paper, compressed sensing based greedy algorithm is used for the design of sparse MMSE equalizer and a convex curve-fitting algorithm is used to find the sub-optimum power allocation parameter at the same sparsity level for GTR-STBC. Our simulation results show that 75-90% of the non-zero equalizer taps can be reduced with a slight relaxation of the mean-squared error (or equivalently slight degradation of bit-error rate performance).

Nanostructured platinum (Pt) catalyst was deposited onto the CNTs with a facile, electroless deposition method, resulting in a Pt-nanowire-coated, CNT sensor (PN-CNT). Convective mass transfer enhancement was shown to improve PN-CNT sensor performance in the non‐enzymatic, amperometric sensing of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In particular, convective enhancement was achieved through the use of high surface area to fluid volume structures and concentration boundary layer confinement in a channel.

Mathematical models can facilitate process understanding and problem detection, and determine appropriate actions in case of mismatch between model and data. Furthermore, calculations may replace measurements where and when the latter are not available, as normally occurs during connections or when instruments or signal transmissions fail. However, advanced hydraulic models rely on a large set of inputs, such as pipe and wellbore geometry, various tuning parameters and fluid properties. The models are therefore time-consuming and difficult to configure in the field, where third-party experts may be needed at each well, to properly initiate the automation system and adjust it during the drilling process. Although the methods described in this paper are relevant to any critical drilling operation, they are applied to Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) as a widely deployed example of drilling automation. In MPD, hydraulic models predict downhole conditions and determine the requisite choke pressure for automatic adjustment. A new method for automatic configuration of key model parameters simplifies the tedious job of setting up the model and ensures that the automation system remains tuned to the well, even without onsite model tuning expertise. The proposed scheme is based on a simple method for separating inaccuracies due to co-linearity in frictional pressure losses and static mud weight. The search for optimal correction factors is based on a sequence of small oscillations of pump rate that can be applied during drilling without interrupting the operation. A massively parallel computing architecture improves the speed of the calibration algorithm proportional to the number of available CPU cores. A set of hydraulic model instances runs in parallel, allowing for efficient testing of changes in input signals within ranges of uncertainty. A method for selecting a subset of the best models that more accurately represent a given well is proposed. Computer simulations demonstrate how the novel calibration scheme allows automatic tuning of the friction factor and density correction factor, giving accurate prediction of the bottom hole pressure (BHP). The tuning scheme is run with a parallel architecture to demonstrate that correct values of unknown configuration parameters can be automatically determined sufficiently fast for real-time drilling control or as an advisory tool. The deployment of automation systems in drilling is hampered by the need for dedicated expert personnel to maintain systems that could have reduced the personnel needed on the rig. The proposed automated physics-based model tuning contributes to removing this roadblock, aiming at making automation systems a more cost-efficient option for drilling operations.

Metrics indicative of shock presence, specifically the skewness of the time derivative of the waveform, the average steepening factor, and a new wavelet-based metric called the shock energy fraction (SEF), are used to quantify the strength and prevalence of acoustic shocks within waveforms recorded 10-305 m from a tethered military aircraft. The derivative skewness is more sensitive to the presence of the largest and steepest shocks, while the ASF and SEF tend to emphasize aggregate behavior of the entire waveform. These metrics are applied at engine conditions ranging from 50% to 150% engine thrust request, over a wide range of angles and distances, to assess the growth and decay of shock waves. The responses of these metrics point to significant shock formation occurring through nonlinear propagation out to 76 m from the microphone array reference position. Although these strongest shocks decay, the metrics point to continued nonlinear propagation in the far-field, out to 305 m. Many of these features are accurately characterized using a nonlinear propagation scheme based on the Burgers equation, but this scheme fails to account for multipath interference and significant atmospheric effects over the long propagation distances, resulting in an overestimation of nonlinearity metrics. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

A wavepacket is defined as a spatially extended source with an axial amplitude distribution that grows, saturates and decays, an axial phase relationship that produces directional noise, and correlation lengths longer than the integral length scales of the turbulent structures. This definition of a wavepacket has the same characteristics as the large-scale turbulent mixing noise; if the turbulent mixing noise can be isolated, the associate equivalent acoustic wavepacket—defined as a pressure fluctuation on a cylinder around the jet nozzle—can be found. An estimate of the frequencydependent, spatial variation in the large-scale turbulent mixing noise comes from a similarity spectra decomposition of the measured autospectral density, which in turn leads to data-educed wavenumber axial spectra associated with the frequency-dependent equivalent wavepackets. This wavepacket eduction technique has been applied to acoustical measurements of an unheated, Mach 1.8 jet in the near and far fields. At both locations, the resulting frequency-dependent, data-educed wavenumber spectra exhibit different types of self-similarity for low and high frequency regimes that become apparent when the axial wavenumber is scaled by the acoustic wavenumber, with a transition band between the two regimes. As expected, the data-educed wavenumber spectra can be used to predict field levels in the dominant radiation lobe. Addition of an uncorrelated source distribution, derived from the similarity spectra decomposition associated with the fine-scale turbulent mixing noise, creates a model that accounts for the sideline levels. This field-prediction ability of the wavepacket-plus-uncorrelated-distribution model is tested using the near and far field measurements. When predicting the field at the other location, the model’s average error is less than 2 dB for St = 0.04-0.25 but increases for larger St because the apparent directivity changes from near to far field, likely due to the frequency dependence of the extended source region. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Beamforming results are decomposed into a reduced-order MWP model and the predicted radiation is validated in terms of level and coherence properties using benchmark measurements. Sound levels and coherence lengths generated by the beamforming results show good agreement with benchmark measurements over a range of frequencies that contribute significantly to the overall radiation. The MWP model is shown to predict full-scale specific features such as multilobe directivity patterns, and the addition of an uncorrelated distribution (UD) model adequately predicts the sideline radiation that is otherwise difficult to reproduce from wavepacket radiation. The MWP model predicted radiation characteristics are an improvement over single-wavepacket models, which do not incorporate spatiotemporal features of the radiation. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, a clear measure of influence with respect to leader position is not adequately studied. Studies with animal systems have shown that leaders who exert strong couplings may be located in front, where they provide energy benefits, or in the middle, where they can be seen by a larger section of the group. In this paper, we systematically vary number of leaders and leader positions in simulated robotic swarms of two different sizes, and assess their effect on steering effectiveness and energy expenditure. In particular, we analyze the effect of placing leaders in the front, middle, and periphery, on the time to converge and lateral acceleration of a swarm of robotic agents as it performs a single turn to reach the desired goal direction. Our results show that swarms with leaders in the middle and periphery take less time to converge than swarms with leaders in the front, while the lateral acceleration between the three placement strategies is not different. We also find that the time to converge towards the goal direction reduces with the increase in percentage of leaders in the swarm, although this value decays slowly beyond the percentage of leaders at 30%. As the swarm size is increased, we find that the leaders in the periphery become less effective in reducing the time to converge. Finally, closer analysis of leader placement and coverage reveals that front leaders within the swarm tend to expand their coverage and move towards the center as the maneuver is performed. Results from this study are expected to inform leader placement strategies towards more effective human swarm interaction systems. © Copyright 2017, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

The compressible material is typically expanded polystyrene or geofoam. Little guidance is available on the development of passive force with an inclusion. To explore this issue, large-scale passive force tests were conducted with and without a geofoam inclusion acting as a barrier between the backfill soil and a simulated bridge abutment. The presence of the geofoam inclusion reduced the passive force by 70% relative to the sand backfill alone. Although the measured force and failure geometry appeared to conform to a log-spiral mechanism when only sand backfill was used, the geofoam inclusion transforms the failure geometry to a Rankine failure mechanism. This suggests that the geofoam acted to reduce the interface friction between the wall and the backfill sand thereby reducing the passive resistance. © ASCE.",Conference Paper,

One of the purposes of these products is to improve the consumer's quality of life. Currently, there is no established method of measuring the social impact of these types of products. As a result, engineers have used their own metrics to assess their product's impact, if at all. Some of the common metrics used include products sold and revenue, which measure the financial success of a product without recognizing the social successes or failures it might have. In this paper we introduce a potential metric, the Product Impact Metric (PIM), which quantifies the impact a product has on impoverished individuals - especially those living in developing countries. It measures social impact broadly in five dimensions: Health, education, standard of living, employment quality, and security. The PIM is inspired by the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) created by the United Nations Development Programme. The MPI measures how the depth of poverty within a nation changes year after year, and the PIM measures how an individual's quality of life changes after being affected by an engineered product. The Product Impact Metric can be used to predict social impacts (using personas that represent real individuals) or measure social impacts (using specific data from products introduced into the market). © 2017 ASME.",Conference Paper,

As the world’s most important fiber crop species, Gossypium hirsutum belongs to the allotetraploid Gossypium clade that consists of six additional species. The lint fiber evolved only once in the history of Gossypium, in the ancestor diploid A-genome species, and this trait was passed on to the allopolyploid species when the A-genome united in a common nucleus with a D-genome from the other ancestor that produced no lint fibers. The domestication history of G. hirsutum involved the collection and use of lint fibers by indigenous people for the purpose of making strings and other textile products; hence, spinnable lint fibers were likely to have evolved under domestication. The geographical distribution of G. hirsutum overlaps with G. barbadense and G. mustelinum, and gene flow among these species has been documented. Therefore, the introgression of novel alleles into G. hirsutum possibly contributed to greater ecological adaptation in colonizing new habitats and providing important sources of genetic variation for artificial selection in the early domestication efforts. In modern Upland cotton, numerous germplasm lines have been developed from crossing with G. barbadense. However, reproductive barriers such as reduced fertility, segregation distortion, and hybrid breakdown are often observed in later generation hybrids between G. hirsutum and the other polyploid species, complicating the task of introgressing new, stably inherited allelic variation from inter specific hybridization. Recent efforts in molecular genetic research have provided insights into the location and effects of QTLs from wild species that are associated with traits important to cotton production.

Current methods to accomplish this have prohibitively long lead times due to extensive sample preparation. This work details the use of quantum dots thermomarkers to measure the surface temperature of thin fibers in a non-contact manner and determine the fibers’ thermal diffusivity. Neural networks are trained on extracting the temperature of a sample from fluorescence spectra in calibrated, steady-state conditions, based on different spectral features such as peak intensity and peak wavelength. The trained neural networks are then used to reconstruct the evolution of the surface temperature in transient heating experiments. In order to determine the thermal properties of a thin fiber, modulated laser heating is applied and an FFT-based method is used to extract the phase and amplitude response of the temperature field at the modulation frequency. The spatiotemporal dependence of the fluorescence signal, obtained by scanning the distance between the excitation and detection laser spots and varying the frequency response due to an axial scan and a frequency scan, is then curve-fit to the resulting decay curves by a photothermal model in order to determine the thermal diffusivity of the fiber. The measured thermal diffusivity (3.3 ± 0.8 × 10−7 m2 s−1) of a synthetic spider silk fiber by the current method has similar properties to other synthetic silk fibers, and demonstrates the ability of the current method to more rapidly measure thermophysical properties of thin fibers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"['FFT', ' Neural networks', ' Photothermal', ' Quantum dots', ' Thermal diffusivity', ' ThermometryAtmospheric temperature', ' Diffusion', ' Fast Fourier transforms', ' Fluorescence', ' Frequency response', ' Laser excitation', ' Nanocrystals', ' Neural networks', ' Silk', ' Surface properties', ' Thermal diffusivity', ' Thermometers', ' Fluorescence spectra', ' Modulation frequencies', ' Photo-thermal', ' Steady-state condition', ' Surface temperatures', ' Synthetic silk fibers', ' Thermometry', ' Trained neural networks', ' Semiconductor quantum dots', ' Detection', ' Fluorescence', ' Lasers', ' Neural Networks']"

The number of bit errors, on a second-by-second basis, are analyzed. The results are different for each test point. Given the uncertain behavior of the preamble detector for the data-aided equalizer and the differing channel conditions between the data-aided equalizer channel and the conventional serial streaming telemetry channel, we are unable to draw any firm comparative conclusions.",Conference Paper,

The friction stir scribe (FSS) technique is a promising method that produces continuous overlap joints between materials with vastly different melting regimes and high-temperature flow characteristics. FSS uses an offset cutting tool at the tip of the friction stir welding pin to create an in situ mechanical interlock between material interfaces. With investments from the U.S. Department of Energy Vehicle Technologies Office and several automotive manufacturers and suppliers, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is developing the FSS process and has demonstrated the viability of joining several material combinations. Details of welding trials, unique challenges, and mitigation strategies in different material combinations will be discussed. Joint characterization, including mechanical tests and joint performance, will also be presented. © 2017, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.",Book Chapter,"['AA6022', ' Aluminum to steel joining', ' Friction stir scribe', ' Friction stir welding', ' Mild steel', ' Surfalex 6s', ' Ultra high strength steelAluminum', ' Automobile manufacture', ' Carbon steel', ' Characterization', ' Cutting tools', ' Friction', ' Friction stir welding', ' Interfaces (materials)', ' Investments', ' Joining', ' Melting', ' Research laboratories', ' Tribology', ' Welding', ' AA6022', ' Automotive manufacturers', ' Friction stir', ' High-temperature flows', ' Pacific northwest national laboratories', ' Surfalex 6s', ' U.S. Department of Energy', ' Ultra high strength steel', ' High strength steel']"

As such, it is a useful representation for complex networks where a coarse description of global system structure is desired without detailing the intricacies of a full state realization. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding a minimal state realization for a given dynamical structure function. Interestingly, some dynamical structure functions require uncontrollable modes in their state realizations to deliver the desired input-output behavior while respecting a specified system structure. As a result, the minimal order necessary to realize a particular dynamical structure function may be greater than that necessary to realize its associated transfer function. Although finding a minimal realization for a given dynamical structure function is difficult in general, we present a straightforward procedure here that works for a simplified class of systems. © 2014 IEEE.",Article,"['Linear systems', ' minimal realization theory', ' systems biologyComplex networks', ' Structured programming', ' Causal dependencies', ' Dynamical structure', ' Input-output behavior', ' Linear time-invariant system', ' Minimal realizations', ' State realizations', ' System structures', ' Systems biology', ' Linear systems']"

Dryland farming is less dense but important in nearly every state in the western U.S and in northern and central Mexico. In addition to wheat, North American dryland farming is important for the production of maize (Zea maize L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), pulses, and oilseeds. The traditional and still prevalent cropping system is a two-year rotation of wheat and summer fallow. In this traditional practice, shallow tillage is used during fallow periods to control weeds and help store moisture in the soil. Sustainability of this practice is limited by soil degradation and erosion and poor water use efficiency. Where adopted, no-till practices improve precipitation storage and use efficiency, which has led to crop intensification and diversification and improvements in soil properties. This chapter highlights some current issues for dryland cropping in North America including integrated pest management for herbicide resistant weeds, diversification of crop rotations, soil carbon dynamics and residue management, and the application of models to aid decision making. Sustaining the dryland cropping systems of North America depends on research and application of practices that reverse past soil degradation, increase cropping system diversity, and apply integrated pest management strategies. Both experimental and modelling approaches are needed to address these challenges. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",Book Chapter,"['Crop diversification', ' Cropping systems models', ' Dryland cropping systems', ' Herbicide resistant weeds', ' No-till', ' Residue managementCrops', ' Efficiency', ' Herbicides', ' Soils', ' Water conservation', ' Weed control', ' Crop diversification', ' Cropping systems', ' Dryland cropping systems', ' Herbicide resistant weeds', ' No-till', ' Residue management', ' Decision making']"
